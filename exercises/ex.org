* Introduction
1. Assume that the utility function $u_i$ represents $i$'s preferences over a set of alternatives $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$. Show that
  1. $i$'s preferences are transitive;
  2. the function $v_i$ defined by $v_i(x)=f(u_i(x))$ also represents $i$'s preferences if $f$ is a strictly increasing function.
  3. Assume now that there are only 2 alternatives, i.e. $X=\{x_1,x_2\}$. Assume that there are 2 people in the society and person 1 prefers $x_1$ over $x_2$ while person 2 prefers $x_2$ over $x_1$. Choose some utility functions $u_1$ and $u_2$ to represent their preferences. Assume that society chooses the alternative $x$ maximizing $u_1(x)+u_2(x)$. 
    - Which alternative does society choose with the utility functions you chose? 
    - Show that a transformation as in the previous subquestion can change society's choice. What is the problem and how does it come about? 

2. Assume that there are $m$ people in society and society has to choose an option from  $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$. The preferences of each member of society can be represented by a utility function $u_i$. Society choose the alternative $x\in X$ maximizing $\sum_{i=1}^m u_i(x)$. Show that the chosen alternative is Pareto efficient.

3. Assume $i$'s preferences over lotteries on the set of outcomes $\{healthy,\,ill,\,dead\}$ satisfy the assumptions of the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theorem and can therefore be represented by three numbers $u^{healthy},\,u^{ill}$ and $u^{dead}$. Assume that  $u^{healthy}=1,\,u^{ill}=0.75$ and $u^{dead}=0$.
  1. Treatment 1 leads to the probability distribution over $(0.3,0.5,0.2)$ (over $\{healthy,\,ill,\,dead\}$) while treatment 2 leads to the probability distribution $(0.4,0.3,0.3)$. Which treatment does $i$ prefer?
  2. Show that $i$'s preferences over lotteries can also be represented by the three numbers $v^{healthy}=a*u^{healthy}+b$, $v^{ill}=a*u^{ill}+b$ and $v^{dead}=a*u^{dead}+b$ where $a>0$ and $b\in\Re$ are some real numbers.
  3. Show by means of an example that $i$'s preferences are not necessarily represented by $v^{healthy}=f(u^{healthy})$, $v^{ill}=f(u^{ill})$ and $v^{dead}=f(u^{dead})$ for some strictly increasing function $f$. Why does this not contradict our result from exercise 1 above?

* Insurance demand
In all exercises let the person be an expected utility maximizer, i.e. the person's choices satisfy the assumptions of the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theorem.

1. Consider a person with utility of income $u(x)=\sqrt{x}$. Is this person risk averse? For the following lotteries, compute the expected income, the certainty equivalent and the risk premium.
  1. Probability $1/3$ for each $1600$, $2500$, and $3600$ Euros.
  2. Income is uniformly distributed between 1600 and 2500 Euros.

2. Consider a person with utility of income $u(x)=\sqrt{x}$. The person has an income of $2500$ Euros but loses $L$ Euros with probability $\alpha$. Determine the certainty equivalent and the risk premium as a function of $\alpha$ and $L$. Is the risk premium increasing or decreasing in $L$? Is  the risk premium increasing or decreasing in $\alpha$?

3. Consider the utility function $u(x)=-e^{-\eta x}$. The person has an income of $1$ and experiences a loss of $1$ with probability $\alpha$.  The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is defined as $-u''(x)/u'(x)$. Compute this coefficient. Let now $\alpha=0.5$ and check whether the certainty equivalent in- or decreases in $\eta$.

4. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2006 of "mini-medical insurance plans". These plans cover routine services, but little hospital coverage and usually have a cap on payouts (say of $ 10.000 ). The premium, however, is only $ 50 per month. Why might people buy a mini-medical plan? Why are such insurance plans not more popular (in a country where a substantial part of the population did/does not have health insurance)?  

# E1: a) E[u]=50, E[x]=2566.6, CE=2500, RP=66.6; b) E[u]=45.185 E[x]=2050 CE=2041.7 RP = 8.3

# E2: \sqrt{CE} = \alpha \sqrt{2500-L}+(1-\alpha) \sqrt{2500}; CE= \alpha^2 (2500-L)+(1-\alpha)^2 2500+\alpha (1-\alpha) 100\sqrt{2500-L} = (5000-L) \alpha^2-5000\alpha+2500+(\alpha -\alpha^2)100 \sqrt{2500-L};  RP=2500-\alpha L -CE=(\alpha -\alpha^2)(5000-L-100 \sqrt{2500-L})

# E3: discuss why $u''$ is a bad measure of risk aversion (problem of multiplying u with a positive number);  $-u''(x)/u'(x)=\eta$ "constant absolute risk aversion" (CARA) -> higher eta means more risk aversion; usually coefficient depends on x but not with CARA preferences; -e^{-\eta CE}=-\alpha-(1-\alpha)e^{-\eta} and therefore CE = -log(\alpha+(1-\alpha)e^{-\eta})/\eta; plug in \alpha=0.5 and draw CE(\eta) numerically

# E4: no covering of large loss is against our theory; more of a smoothing out of expected costs than a real insurance; maybe mandate to treat in emergency rooms allows poor people to default on large claims (or get those waved) while claims up to 10.000 the provider may be able to collect; in any case catastrophe plans that cover only large losses are much more common
