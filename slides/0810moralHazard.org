* The slope of demand
** How does health care demand vary in the price the patient has to pay?
a higher price (i.e. less insurance)... 
1. ...does not affect the amount of health care a patient consumes
2. ...reduces the amount of health care a patient consumes
3. ...increases the amount of health care a patient consumes

\pause

\vspace*{1cm}
How do you design a study that settles the argument?

# health care is special: go to doctor grudgingly when ill
# normal economics: higher price leads to lower demanded quantity (some care is optional like going to doc with flu)
# people might save on preventive care when less insured which leads to higher health care expenses in the long run; expensive emergency room visits in the US where insurance must not be asked for substitute cheap primary care

# ** Demand in a simple model

# - derive demand in a standard 101 micro model and show it is decreasing in price


* Field experimental evidence

** RAND health insurance experiment I
- 70s in the US
- 2000 families
- randomly assigned plans differing in copay and stop-loss

- rough price elasticity estimate: -0.2

# arc elasticity: percentage change in x over percentage change in y where percentage change in x is (x_1-x_2)/(x_1/2+x_2/2); x would be average total costs and y would be average out of pocket expenditures; one can compare any two plans with this and the -0.2 is some sort of average (the range is from -0.1 to -0.5).

** Oregon I

- Medicaid expansion in Oregon (2008)
- medium-low income 
- due to limited budget, lottery for eligibility
- no copayment, no premium
- use lottery success as instrument for health insurance
- roughly: compare lottery winners to losers

\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Oregon1}
\tiny{source: Einav and Finkelstein 2017}\normalsize

# procedure: 75000 applied and 30000 were selected; if selected apply for Medicaid and if you met the criteria you got it; comprehensive coverage without cost sharing;
# winning in the lottery increased prob of having health insurance by 25 percentage points 
# 2 years after lottery Oregon had enough funds to also extend to "control group"
# estimates are IV estimated of local average treatment effect where winning the lottery is instrument for having coverage

** Oregon II
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Oregon2}
\tiny{source: Einav and Finkelstein 2017}\normalsize
- increase in health care spending due to Medicaid roughly 775$ per year (approx. 25%)

* Welfare and moral hazard
** Welfare 
- why is "moral hazard" actually a problem?

# deadweight loss in demand diagram

* Ex ante moral hazard
** Ex ante moral hazard
- what is the impact of insurance on preventive behavior, life style etc.?
#

- uninsured in the US who become eligible for Medicare when turning 65

Results: after turning 65...
- number of physician visits increases for low-educated by 35 (41)% for men (women)
- probability of engaging in vigorous physical activity falls by 21 (13)%

* The donut hole
** A simplistic model

- patient chooses amount $x$ to spend on medication/treatment
- utility is separable: $u(x)= h(x)-c(x)$ where
  - health benefit $h$ is increasing and strictly concave
  - copayment $c(x)$ depends on insurance contract
- maximization problem $\max_x h(x)-c(x)$
  - foc: $h'(x^*)=c'(x^*)$
- graphical example
  - suppose the copayment is 10%, i.e. $c(x)=0.1x$ and therefore $c'(x)=0.1$ is constant
  - $h'$ is decreasing as $h$ is strictly concave

** The donut hole I

- Medicare Part D provides coverage for elderly for medication

\includegraphics[width=8cm]{donut}

How will the distribution of medication expenditure for Medicare recipients look like?

** Out of pocket expenditures: German example 
- single civil servant in NRW in tarif group W3
  - health insurance for 50% of health care expenditures: 275 EUR per month, repays  3 months of contributions if no use (effective deductible of 825 EUR)
  - state subsidy for 50% of health care expenditures ("Beihilfe"): deductible ("Kostendämpfungspauschale") of 450 EUR

\end{tikzpicture}

- What are the implications for the expenditure profile?

# do not expect expenditures around the kinks, i.e. around 900 or around 1650


* Out of sample predictions
** Out of sample predictions

- A health insurer considers to introduce a copayment of 10% and asks you how this will affect expenditures. What do you do?

# price elasticity of -0.2 (note that RAND used the arc elasticity, i.e. the percentage increase in out of pocket price would be (10-0)/((10+0)/2)=2=200%), hence people with expenditures are expected to consume 2*0.2=40% less

# simple structural model, e.g. u_i=-(\theta-h)^2 +m, before change, i.e.  without copayment, everyone chooses h=\theta, this gives the distribution of theta; under the new regime u_i is -(\theta-h)^2+m-0.1h, determine which h everyone will choose now




* Utilization management
** Utilization management (UM)
- insurance causes over consumption of care 
  - copayments are an imperfect way to fight this problem
  - what else can insurer do to fight over consumption of care?

** Empirical evidence on utilization management I

- Wickizer, Wheeler and Feldstein (1989) and Wheeler and Wickizer (1990)
  - data from one US insurer 
  - 41% of groups buy plan with preadmission certification and concurrent review
  - results: 
    - 3.7% less hospital admissions but no effect on length of stay
    - UM more effective if in community admission rates are high or hospital capacity is idle 
  
- Scheffler, Sullivan and Ko (1991)
  - Blue Cross/Blue shield plans

# preadmission cert.: nonemergency hospital admission has to be cleared by insurer before admittance
# concurrent review: number of hospital days is specified in advance and increases have to be cleared by insurer
# retrospective review: review case ex post and advise provider to follow insurer protocol if care deemed unnecessary
# denial of payment: insurer will not pay for care that is not in line with insurer protocol
# discharge planning: provider must make a plan for care after discharge before admitting
# problem: selection! groups choosing UM may know they need it

** Empirical evidence on utilization management II
- Lessler and Wickizer (2000)
  - one US health insurer with different groups (some with preadmission certification + concurrent review)
  - only cardiovascular disease patients
  - results
    - almost no requests for admission rejected
    - 17.5% of cases length of stay was reduced (19% for surgical procedures)
    - readmission rates: 12.4% no reduction, 9.4% if 1 day reduction, 14.6% if 2+ days reduction
# no admission reduction: cardiovascular have no discretion, or providers know guidelines very well, or ineffective

** Gatekeeping
- gatekeeping: specialty care requires referral by general practicioner
  - what are the advantages?

\pause 

- Ferris er al. (2001)
  - Harvards Vanguard eliminated gatekeeping after 25 years in 1998 
  - compare utilization before and after elimination

| physician visits                   | gatekeeping | no gatekeeping |
|------------------------------------+-------------+----------------|
| /                                  |           < |                |
| number specialty visits / 6 months |         .78 |            .78 |
| number first visit specialist /6m  |         .19 |            .22 |
| number primary care visits /6m     |        1.21 |           1.19 |

# no statistical significance

# potential advantage: continuity of care i.e. GP has overview and manages as expert adviser, substitute expensive specialty by cheap GP, use capitation
