* Supplier induced demand
** Physician roles
- roles
  - supplier
  - adviser
- renumeration can lead to non-aligned incentives

** Supplier induced demand 
- some observations:
  - physician density increased in Germany from 16 to 41 from 1970 to 2014 (#physicians/10000inhabitants)
  - no under-employment of physicians
  - areas with higher density of surgeons have more surgeries/capita but not lower surgical fees (Fuchs 1978)

*** Supplier induced demand (SID)
Physicians control quantity of treatment, that is, demand is not independent from supply but induced by the supplier. They can do so because they control information (about necessity, state of the art etc.) that the patient does not have.

** Supplier induced demand 
- a couple of new physicians arrive in a town in which all citizens have comprehensive health insurance
  - what happens in a normal supply and demand framework?
  - what happens under supplier induced demand?
# comprehensive insurance: demand is fixed quantity, i.e. DD is vertical, (and price maybe regulated to fixed p to just equate supply and demand originally);  supply curve shifts outward and demand stays fixed, i.e. supply is under utilized or insurers can lower the fee and still satisfy demand; every doctor induces as much demand as needed to fill up his time -> demand shifts to the right and traded quantity goes up while price could stay same (fig 8.2 ZBK)

- factors making SID easier
  - comprehensive insurance
  - riskless treatment technology
# no pushback from patients as no overtreatment concerns

** Supplier induced demand: model
- price per unit of medical care: $p$ (exogenous, regulated)
- $a$ physicians, $n$ inhabitants, density $\delta=a/n$
- "primary demand" for care per capita is $M$ (no inducement)
- primary care per physician: $nM/a=M/\delta$
- each physician can induce additional demand $s$ leading to demand $M/\delta+s$
- working time of a physician: $t=\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}$
# physisican adapts working time to demand up to an upper limit 1
- disposable income of  physician: $y(pt)$ with $y'>0, \,y''\leq 0$
# progressive income taxation
- physician utility $u(y,t,s)$ 
  - increasing  and concave in $y$  
  - decreasing and concave in $s$ and $t$
- physician maximizes over $s$
- for simplicity: $u(y,t,s)=\sqrt{y}-t-\gamma s$, $y(pt)= pt$
# $u(y,t,s)=\log{(y)}-t-0.5 s^2$, $y(pt)=\beta pt$

** Supplier induced demand: analysis
$$u(y,t,s)=\sqrt{ p t}-t-\gamma s  =\sqrt{p\min\{M/\delta+s,1\} }-\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}-\gamma s$$

# $$u(y,t,s)=\log{\beta p t}-t-0.5s^2 \\ =\log{\beta p\min\{M/\delta+s,1\} }-\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}-0.5 s^2$$

- if $M/\delta+s<1$, then
$$\frac{d u}{d s}=\frac{\sqrt{p}}{\sqrt{M/\delta+s}}-1-\gamma $$
# $$\frac{d u}{d s}=\frac{1}{M/\delta+s}-1-s $$
- if $M/\delta+s>1$, then 
$$\frac{d u}{d s}=-\gamma $$

# s is never higher than $1-M/\delta$

** Supplier induced demand: results

- if $M/\delta\geq 1$, then $s=\dots$ and $t =\dots$
# 0, 1; primary demand is so high that all physicians are totally busy without inducement
- if $M/\delta< 1$
  - if $\gamma$ is very high, then 
    - $s=\dots$ 
    -  $t=\dots$ 
  - if $\gamma$ is low, then 
    - $s=\dots$  
    - $t=\dots$
# 0, M/\delta
# sqrt: s^*=p/(1+\gamma)^2-M/\delta , unless negative -> then 0 , or >1-M/delta
# log: s^*=\min\{1-M/\delta,M/\delta\}$ and $t=M/\delta+s^*$


** Supplier induced demand: results 
- positive demand inducement requires a fee for service
# p>0
- assume $p/(1+\gamma)^2<1$
- how does the solution evolve when increasing $\delta$?
  - $\delta\leq M$:
  - $M<\delta\leq M/(p/(1+\gamma)^2)$:
  - $\delta>M/(p/(1+\gamma)^2)$:
# 1. no inducement; proportional increase of billed services per patient, $a/n=\delta$, in \delta,
# 2. inducement 0; t<1; billed service per patient is constant in delta 
# 3. inducement p/(1+\gamma)^2-M/\delta; billed service per patient is increasing in delta as s is 


- plot billed services per patient as a function of \delta
# proportional increase, than flat then concave increase (fig 8.3 in ZBK)

\vspace*{1cm}

- what if $p/(1+\gamma)^2>1$?
# no flat bit in graph above as regime 2does not exist

- driving force:
  - income effect
# higher delta reduces income, increases marginal utility of income and leads eventually to demand inducement

- how does demand inducement change when the fee for service $p$ increases (slightly)?
# either no effect (in 1 and 2) or lower s (in 3)
# in general ambiguous: income effect makes physician richer -> less inducement; substitution effect: higher p makes inducement more attractive -> more inducement

** Supplier induced demand: alternative explanations
- SID fits empirical observation that more physicians lead to more services
- alternative explanations
  1. permanent excess demand
  2. higher quality of treatment if more physicians around
  3. reverse causality
# ad 1: basically, we are always in regime 1 above
# ad 2: more doctors means they have more time and provide better services (less waiting time etc.) which increases demand
# ad 3: new doctors settle at places where demand is (expected) to increase; (less convincing for variation over time)

- empirical design should try to tease these explanations apart
  - how does our model provide different predictions than the 3 explanations above? how to design a convincing empirical study?
# ad 1: billed services by patient increase linearly and then not at all (similar to regimes 1 and 2 in our model) while in our model eventually they increase again
# ad 2: maybe no plateau where billed services per patient do not increase at intermediate levels; 
# ad 3: one has to explicitly account for physician's location choice

** Some empirical evidence
- cite:fuchs1978supply uses cross-sectional variation and tries to rule out (3) by statistically accounting for the supply of surgeons (2-stage least square)
  - method criticized as it also indicates SID in child births
- cite:gruber1996physician show that decline in birth rates in the 1970s was accompanied by an increase in caesarean sections


** (Danish) Physicians respond to incentives I
- Reform of physician pay in Copenhagen *city* (Denmark) in October 1987
  - before: capitation
  - after: mixed system of capitation and fee for service
- control: Copenhagen *county* had new enumeration already
- physicians were asked to record all activities in a given week at three points in time (February/March 87, February/March 88, November 88)
- 75 of 265 GPs participated in all three waves

* Cost saving incentives and communication
** Incentives for physicians
- moral hazard
- insurances incentivize physicians to save costs

** Possible conflict of interest between patient and physician
- insured patient wants best treatment  (no matter what costs)
- physician takes costs into account in prescription  behavior
- patient has to communicate symptoms etc. to physician to allow accurate diagnosis
  - incentives to exaggerate

** Communication model
- true health state unknown
- fully insured patient reports symptoms to physician
- physician hears report privately observes signal about health state
- physician prescribes treatment
#
- prior information (commonly known): 
  - likelihood of different health states
  - probability distribution of symptoms given each health state
  - probability distribution of signals given each health state

- payoffs (commonly known):
  - $u_P$ depending on health state and treatment
  - $u_D=u_P- \beta c(treatment)$ 
  - welfare: $u_P-c(treatment)$

** Cost saving incentives can backfire: example
- information (see section 3 cite:schottmueller2013cifd)
| prior        | 2/5 | 2/5 | 1/5 |
|--------------+-----+-----+-----|
| /            |  <  |     |     |
| signal/state | A   | B   |   C |
|--------------+-----+-----+-----|
| (0,0)        | 0   | 0   |   1 |
| (0,1)        | 0   | 4/5 |   0 |
| (1,0)        | 1/5 | 1/5 |   0 |
| (1,1)        | 4/5 | 0   |   0 |
- $u_P$ and costs
| treatment/state | A |   B |   C | costs |
|-----------------+---+-----+-----+-------|
| /               | < |     |  >  |       |
| a               | 8 | 9.7 | 9.2 |     5 |
| b               | 4 |   9 | 9.6 |     3 |
| c               | 0 |   5 |  10 |     1 |

- say $\beta=0$; what is the equilibrium? any problems for welfare?
- say $\beta=1$; what is the equilibrium? any problems for welfare?

** Variation of the example
- let $\beta = 1$ and the prior be $2/5+x$, $2/5+x$, $1/5-2x$ for $x\in(0,1/10)$
  - what is the equilibrium? 
  - how do equilibrium costs compare with the equilibrium costs when $\beta = 0$?

** Communication model: results
following cite:schottmueller2013cifd:
- exaggeration leads to worse information for physician
- worse diagnosis can reduce welfare and in some cases increase costs
- if the physicians signal is sufficiently informative, $\beta=1$ leads to higher welfare than $\beta = 0$
- if cost differences between treatments are sufficiently large, $\beta=1$ leads to higher welfare than $\beta = 0$
- welfare maximal $\beta$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$
- copayments can reduce the conflict of interest and increase welfare

Can you draw a link from the Hippocratic oath to the model?

** Empirical evidence of trust and physician pay I
 cite:kerr1997primary report on "How satisfied are GPs with their relationship with patients?"
-  71% were very or somewhat satisfied with relationships with capitated patients (compared with 88% for overall practice)
-  64% were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of care they provided to capitated patients (compared with 88% for overall practice),
- 51% were very or somewhat satisfied with their ability to treat capitated patients according to their own best judgment (compared with 79% for overall practice)
- 50% were very or somewhat satisfied with their ability to obtain specialty referrals (compared with 59% for overall practice) 
# be careful: rather suggestive questioning
