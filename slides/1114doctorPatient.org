* Supplier induced demand
** Physician roles
- roles
  - supplier
  - adviser
- renumeration can lead to non-aligned incentives

** Supplier induced demand 
- some observations:
  - physician density increased in Germany from 16 to 41 from 1970 to 2014 (#physicians/10000 inhabitants)
  - no under-employment of physicians
  - areas with higher density of surgeons have more surgeries/capita but not lower surgical fees (Fuchs 1978)

*** Supplier induced demand (SID)
Physicians control quantity of treatment, that is, demand is not independent from supply but induced by the supplier beyond a perfectly informed patient's optimal choice. Physicians can induce because they control information (about necessity, state of the art etc.) that the patient does not have.

** Supplier induced demand 
- a couple of new physicians arrive in a town in which all citizens have comprehensive health insurance
  - what happens in a normal supply and demand framework?
  - what happens under supplier induced demand?
# comprehensive insurance: demand is fixed quantity, i.e. DD is vertical, (and price maybe regulated to fixed p to just equate supply and demand originally);  supply curve shifts outward and demand stays fixed, i.e. supply is under utilized or insurers can lower the fee and still satisfy demand; every doctor induces as much demand as needed to fill up his time -> demand shifts to the right and traded quantity goes up while price could stay same (fig 8.2 ZBK)

- factors making SID easier
  - comprehensive insurance
  - riskless treatment technology
# no pushback from patients as no overtreatment concerns

** Supplier induced demand: model
- price per unit of medical care: $p$ (exogenous, regulated)
- $a$ physicians, $n$ inhabitants, density $\delta=a/n$
- "primary demand" for care per capita is $M$ (no inducement)
- primary care per physician: $nM/a=M/\delta$
- each physician can induce additional demand $s\in[0,\infty)$ leading to demand $M/\delta+s$
- working time of a physician: $t=\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}$
# physisican adapts working time to demand up to an upper limit 1
- disposable income of  physician: $y(pt)$ with $y'>0, \,y''\leq 0$
# progressive income taxation
- physician utility $u(y,t,s)$ 
  - increasing  and concave in $y$  
  - decreasing and concave in $s$ and $t$
- physician maximizes over $s$
- for simplicity: $u(y,t,s)=\sqrt{y}-t-\gamma s$, $y(pt)= pt$
# $u(y,t,s)=\log{(y)}-t-0.5 s^2$, $y(pt)=\beta pt$

** Supplier induced demand: analysis
$$u(y,t,s)=\sqrt{ p t}-t-\gamma s  =\sqrt{p\min\{M/\delta+s,1\} }-\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}-\gamma s$$

# $$u(y,t,s)=\log{\beta p t}-t-0.5s^2 \\ =\log{\beta p\min\{M/\delta+s,1\} }-\min\{M/\delta+s,1\}-0.5 s^2$$

- if $M/\delta+s<1$, then
$$\frac{d u}{d s}=\frac{\sqrt{p}}{2\sqrt{M/\delta+s}}-1-\gamma $$
# $$\frac{d u}{d s}=\frac{1}{M/\delta+s}-1-s $$
- if $M/\delta+s>1$, then 
$$\frac{d u}{d s}=-\gamma $$

# s is never higher than $1-M/\delta$

- solution candidates:
  - no inducement $s=0$ if $M/\delta\geq 1$ or $\frac{\sqrt{p}}{2\sqrt{M/\delta}}-1-\gamma<0$
  - interior inducement $s=p/(4(1+\gamma)^2)-M/\delta$
  - maximal inducement $s=1-M/\delta$ if $p/(4(1+\gamma)^2)\geq1$ 

** Supplier induced demand: results 
- positive demand inducement requires a fee for service
# p>0
- assume $p/(4(1+\gamma)^2)<1$
- how does the solution evolve when increasing $\delta$?
  - $\delta\leq M$:
  - $M<\delta\leq M/(\frac{p}{4(1+\gamma)^2})$:
  - $\delta>M/(\frac{p}{4(1+\gamma)^2})$:
# 1. no inducement; proportional increase of billed services per patient, $a/n=\delta$, in \delta,
# 2. inducement 0; t<1; billed service per patient is constant in delta 
# 3. inducement p/(1+\gamma)^2-M/\delta; billed service per patient is increasing in delta as s is 


- plot billed services per patient as a function of \delta
# proportional increase, than flat then concave increase (fig 8.3 in ZBK)

\vspace*{1cm}

- what if $p/(4(1+\gamma)^2)>1$?
# no flat bit in graph above as regime 2does not exist

- driving force:
  - income effect
# higher delta reduces income, increases marginal utility of income and leads eventually to demand inducement

- how does demand inducement change when the fee for service $p$ increases (slightly)?
# either no effect (in 1 and 2) or higher s (in 3)
# in general ambiguous: income effect makes physician richer -> less inducement; substitution effect: higher p makes inducement more attractive -> more inducement

** Supplier induced demand: alternative explanations
- SID fits empirical observation that more physicians lead to more services
- alternative explanations
  1. permanent excess demand
  2. higher quality of treatment if more physicians around
  3. reverse causality
# ad 1: basically, we are always in regime 1 above
# ad 2: more doctors means they have more time and provide better services (less waiting time etc.) which increases demand
# ad 3: new doctors settle at places where demand is (expected) to increase; (less convincing for variation over time)

- empirical design should try to tease these explanations apart
  - how does our model provide different predictions than the 3 explanations above? how to design a convincing empirical study?
# ad 1: billed services by patient increase linearly and then not at all (similar to regimes 1 and 2 in our model) while in our model eventually they increase again
# ad 2: maybe no plateau where billed services per patient do not increase at intermediate levels; 
# ad 3: one has to explicitly account for physician's location choice

** Some empirical evidence
- cite:fuchs1978supply uses cross-sectional variation and tries to rule out (3) by statistically accounting for the supply of surgeons (2-stage least square)
  - method criticized as it also indicates SID in child births 
- cite:gruber1996physician show that decline in birth rates in the 1970s was accompanied by an increase in Caesarean sections

# often studied how fee changes for procedure A affect quantity procedure B: income and substitution effect may cancel   for A but go in same direction for B -> study B 

** Second wave of SID studies I
- suppose a physiscian can offer 2 services
- physician has utility $u(y,s_1+s_2)$ where $Y$ is income, $s_i\in[0,\infty)$ is inducement for service $i$
- assume $u_y>0$, $u_{yy}<0$, $u_s<0$, $u_{ss}<0$
- $y=p_1 x_1(s_1)+p_2 x_2(s_2)$ where $x_i$ is the level of service $i$ and we assume $x_i'>0$, $x_i''<0$, and $p_i$ is the fee for service $i$

- solving the utility maximization problem:
$$p_1 x_1'(s_1) = -u_s/u_y $$
$$ p_2x_2'(s_2) = -u_s/u_y$$

- how does the optimal $s_1$ and $s_2$ change if $p_1$ increases?
  - income effect:
  - substitution effect:
# income effect: higher p_1 leads to higher y and therefore lower u_y -> less inducement (both s_1 and s_2)
# subs effect: higher $p_1$ increases MB of s_1 -> higher s_1 -> higher -u_s -> lower s_2

** Second wave of SID studies II
- how to empirically test for SID given the model above?
# empirical test of SID: check how level of other services respond (as effect on service for which price changes is unclear)
\vspace*{1cm}

- some empirical evidence supporting SID along these lines, e.g. cite:yip1998physician shows that thoracic surgeons increased volume of both Medicare and non-Medicare patients when Medicare fees were cut significantly


** (Danish) Physicians respond to incentives I
- Reform of physician pay in Copenhagen *city* (Denmark) in October 1987
  - before: capitation
  - after: mixed system of capitation and fee for service
- control: Copenhagen *county* had new enumeration already
- physicians were asked to record all activities in a given week at three points in time (February/March 87, February/March 88, November 88)
- 75 of 265 GPs participated in all three waves

* Credence good model

** Credence good
- credence good: expert knows more about the quality a consumer needs than the consumer
- physician = expert, patient = consumer
- potential efficiency problems:
  - overcharging
  - overtreatment
  - undertreatment
  - excessive search
- how should physician renumeration be structured to avoid problems above?
- how does this depend on environment?

**  Basic setup
- consumers
  - continuum of consumers
  - each consumer has either /major/ or /minor/ problem 
    - major problem can be fixed by expensive treatment $\bar c$
    - minor problem can be fixed by cheap treatment $\underline c<\bar c$ or expensive treatment 
  - do not know problem and assign prob $h$ to major
  - cost of visiting expert: $d$ per expert
  - utility: $v>\bar c+d$ if fixed, 0 otherwise (minus price in both cases)
  - homogeneity: all consumers are the same
- $n\geq 2$ experts
  - know problem and recommend treatment
  - bear cost of treatment and receives price from consumer
  - maximize pofit: price minus cost
- prices: 
  - $\bar p$ for $\bar c$ and $\underline p$ for $\underline c$ (for now fixed)

** Possible assumptions/environments

- /commitment/ 
  - consumer is committed to follow the expert's recommendation
  - consumer cannot reject treatment and visit another expert
- /liability/ 
  - expert is liable in case of undertreatment and will therefore never administer $\underline c$ if the problem is major
- /verifiability/
  - consumer can verify which treatment is administered \rightarrow overcharging cannot occur

** Benchmark: no liability, no verifiability
*** Market breakdown                               :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
If commitment but neither liability not verifiability hold, the market outcome is inefficient.

*** :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

- which treatment will experts administer and which price will they charge?
# administer cheap treatment and charge higher price -> undertreatment and overcharging!

# double diagnosis is inefficient, hence case without commitment will not give efficiency

\vspace*{1cm}

- what is the equilibrium if experts set prices before consumers decide which expert to visit?
# one price: $p=\underline c$, only cheap treatment are administered, consumers visit experts iff $(1-h)v-\underline c-d\geq 0$.

\vspace*{1cm}

- (possible?) remedy: separation of diagnosis and treatment
# diagnose physicians diagnose at fixed price, treatment administerer (pharmacists?) provide demanded treatment at price equal (or larger) than cost; problem: economies of scope, i.e separation will in practice lead to additional costs (in model: duplication of $d$)

** Verifiability and commitment
- what will experts do if $\bar p-\bar c>\underline p-\underline c$?
# overtreatment: always administer expensive treatment
- what will experts do if $\bar p-\bar c<\underline p-\underline c$?
# undertreatment: always administer cheap treatment
- what is the equilibrium if experts set prices before consumers decide which expert to visit?
# $\bar p = \bar c$ and $\underline p = \underline c$ and efficient treatment choice

** Liability and commitment
- what will experts do if $\bar p >\underline p$?
# overcharge: always claim that expensive treatment done and charge high price, but efficient treatment choice
- what will experts do if $\bar p <\underline p$?
# overcharge: always claim that cheap treatment done and charge higher price, but efficient treatment choice
- what is the equilibrium if experts set prices before consumers decide which expert to visit?
# \bar p = \underline p = \underline c + h(\bar c-\underline c) and efficient treatment choice

** Liability only
- assume $n\geq 4$ and $d$ not too high (as high $d$ is like commitment)
- assume that experts set prices before consumers choose which expert to visit

*** Specialization equilibrium :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
At least two experts post prices $\underline{p}=\underline{c}$ and $\bar{p}>\bar{c}+d$ and at least two experts post prices $\underline{p}\leq \bar{p}=\bar{c}$. The former diagnose honestly while the latter always recommend the expensive treatment. Consumers visit the former experts first and go to the latter if a major problem is diagnosed.

*** :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
- inefficiency: duplication of diagnosis cost $d$

** Summary and comments

- right prices can solve some of the problems
  - same prices for all treatments avoid overcharging
  - same markups for all treatments avoid under-/overtreatment
- competitive equilibria are  efficient if commitment + either liability or verifiability hold
- specialization can emerge (without commitment)
- does it matter whether consumers are insured, i.e. insurance pays price to expert, or not?
# consumers are indifferent between experts in all equilibria; if they choose cheapest expert as tie breaker (i.e. when expecting right/same treatment) equilibria still exist; small proportional copay would ensure that; if consumers have no copay and do not know prices, then prices have to be regulated

* Cost saving incentives and communication
** Incentives for physicians
- moral hazard
- insurances incentivize physicians to save costs

** Possible conflict of interest between patient and physician
- insured patient wants best treatment  (no matter what costs)
- physician takes costs into account in prescription  behavior
- patient has to communicate symptoms etc. to physician to allow accurate diagnosis
  - incentives to exaggerate

** Communication model
- true health state unknown
- fully insured patient reports symptoms to physician
- physician hears report privately observes signal about health state
- physician prescribes treatment
#
- prior information (commonly known): 
  - likelihood of different health states
  - probability distribution of symptoms given each health state
  - probability distribution of signals given each health state

- payoffs (commonly known):
  - $u_P$ depending on health state and treatment
  - $u_D=u_P- \beta c(treatment)$ 
  - welfare: $u_P-c(treatment)$

** Cost saving incentives can backfire: example
- information (see section 3 cite:schottmueller2013cifd)
| prior        | 2/5 | 2/5 | 1/5 |
|--------------+-----+-----+-----|
| /            |  <  |     |     |
| signal/state | A   | B   |   C |
|--------------+-----+-----+-----|
| (0,0)        | 0   | 0   |   1 |
| (0,1)        | 0   | 4/5 |   0 |
| (1,0)        | 1/5 | 1/5 |   0 |
| (1,1)        | 4/5 | 0   |   0 |
- $u_P$ and costs
| treatment/state | A |   B |   C | costs |
|-----------------+---+-----+-----+-------|
| /               | < |     |  >  |       |
| a               | 8 | 9.7 | 9.2 |     5 |
| b               | 4 |   9 | 9.6 |     3 |
| c               | 0 |   5 |  10 |     1 |

- say $\beta=0$; what is the equilibrium? any problems for welfare?
- say $\beta=1$; what is the equilibrium? any problems for welfare?

** Variation of the example
- let $\beta = 1$ and the prior be $2/5+x$, $2/5+x$, $1/5-2x$ for $x\in(0,1/10)$
  - what is the equilibrium? 
  - how do equilibrium costs compare with the equilibrium costs when $\beta = 0$?

** Communication model: results
following cite:schottmueller2013cifd:
- exaggeration leads to worse information for physician
- worse diagnosis can reduce welfare and in some cases increase costs
- if the physicians signal is sufficiently informative, $\beta=1$ leads to higher welfare than $\beta = 0$
- if cost differences between treatments are sufficiently large, $\beta=1$ leads to higher welfare than $\beta = 0$
- welfare maximal $\beta$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$
- copayments can reduce the conflict of interest and increase welfare

Can you draw a link from the Hippocratic oath to the model?

** Empirical evidence of trust and physician pay I
 cite:kerr1997primary report on "How satisfied are GPs with their relationship with patients?"
-  71% were very or somewhat satisfied with relationships with capitated patients (compared with 88% for overall practice)
-  64% were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of care they provided to capitated patients (compared with 88% for overall practice),
- 51% were very or somewhat satisfied with their ability to treat capitated patients according to their own best judgment (compared with 79% for overall practice)
- 50% were very or somewhat satisfied with their ability to obtain specialty referrals (compared with 59% for overall practice)
