* Adverse selection with fixed coverage
** Model
- fixed insurance contract, e.g. full coverage
- large heterogenous population: 
  - differ in willingness to pay for contract
  - differ in expected costs 
- heterogeneity is unobserved by insurers
- insurers set premium
- for now: insurances have no costs


*** Question 							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
- Who is likely to have a higher willingness to pay for insurance: those with low or high expected costs?

# willingness to pay: expected cost + risk premium

** Demand and marginal cost

# Figure 1 of E&F: downward sloping demand, MC and AC
# MC(0)=AC(0) 
# risk premium (abstracting from wealth effects): difference between demand and MC, positive as risk averse, i.e. D>MC
# 

** Competitive equilibrium

- if many insurers compete on premium, equilibrium premium equals average costs (Bertrand competition)
- possible inefficiency: too little insurance in equilibrium
# if AC curve intersects demand, then not everyone buys insurance and market equilibrium, i.e. most healthy do not although their willingness to pay is above MC; problem: if I want to attract marginal buyer I have to lower premium for all inframarginal buyers 

Result:
- adverse selection leads to too little insurance
- insurance mandate (?)
# what is the regulated premium? force people to buy insurance at premium above wtp?
- premium subsidy
# shifts demand up, reduces inefficiency (unless high shadow cost of public funds); imagine a head tax of $T$ that is then paid as a subsidy when buying insurance -> if T is high enough to get everyone to insure then everyone is better off unless there are administrative costs of taxation

** Special cases

- no inefficiency
# AC in between MC and D, never intersects D

- complete unravelling
# AC completely above demand (intersects demand and MC at Q=0)

** Gender specific premia

- suppose women tend to have lower expected costs than men
- who will have the lower premium, if insurance companies are allowed to discriminate based on gender?
- if insurance companies are prohibited to discriminate based on gender, who benefits? who loses?

# female premium is lower with discrimination; i.e. women lose from regulation and men gain and women will be more likely to uninsured with regulation while men are less likely to be uninsured

** Gender specific premia
- unisex tarif were introduced in Montana, US in 1983 by law 
- Wall Street Journal (1987) reported the following changes in premia
  
|                  | women |  men |
|------------------+-------+------|
| /                |    <  |      |
| life insurance   |  +15% |  -3% |
| health insurance |  -13% | +28% |
| auto insurance   |  +49% | -16% |

** Loading factors
- insurance have administrative costs
- MC curve is expected payout + administrative costs of the contract
- admin cost shift MC up
- "loading": difference between premium and expected payout

Results:

- not necessarily optimal to insure everyone $\rightarrow$ insurance mandate not optimal
- effects of adverse selection as before (underinsurance in equilibrium)

** Evidence for selection
- recipients of Medicare can in many parts of the US choose between traditional plan and HMO plan (limited network and benefits)
  - expenditures 6 months before enrolling in HMO: 63% of average
  - expenditures 6 months after disenrolling from HMO: 160% of average

- Ellis (1985) reports of an employer that switched from offering one insurance plan to offering 3 insurance plans with different coverage levels
  - employees choosing high coverage plan had four times as high expenditures than the one in the low coverage plan

* Screening

** Rothschild-Stiglitz Model (screening with perfect competition)

- consumers
  - two risk types: prob of loss either $\alpha_l$ or $\alpha_h>\alpha_l$
  - otherwise identical (utility function $u$ with $u'>0$ and $u''<0$, wealth $W$, loss $L$)
  - risk type is private information of consumer

- insurers
  - risk neutral
  - zero administrative costs
  - offer menus of coverage/premium pairs
  - many insurance companies
  - knows share of high risk type in population $\gamma\in(0,1)$

- equilibrium
  - system of contracts, i.e. coverage/premium pairs, such that (i) every offered contract yields non-negative expected profits, (ii) no insurance can increase its expected profits by offering another contract, (iii) consumers maximize expected utility. 

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: first best (no information asymmetry)

- benchmark: risk types are known by insurances
- what is equilibrium?

# full insurance, fig 5.3 on p.172 in ZBK
# or figure with coverage on x-axis and premium on y-axis
# high risk would like to choose low risk contract

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (no pooling)

- high risk type has higher demand for coverage
- single crossing: 
  - in $W_1$, $W_2$ diagram, $h$ has a flatter indifference curve than $l$
  - in coverage, premium diagram, $h$ has a steeper indifference curve
- pooling equilibrium: both risk types buy the same contract

Result:
- pooling equilibrium does not exist
# fig 5.4 on p. 174 in ZBK

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (separating equilibrium)
- one contract for each risk type and each prefers his contract
- as $h$ is more eager to buy insurance, he has more coverage (higher $W_2$, lower $W_1$) in equilibrium
- insurers make zero profit on $h$ contract
# otherwise compete by offering this contract at epsilon lower premium
- $h$ type has full insurance, $W_1=W_2$ in equilibrium
# otherwise offer full coverage where $h$ is indifferent and give him epsilon lower premium; as h is more eager than l, l will not buy new contract but as more cov is efficient it yields higher profits for epsilon small
- insurers make zero profits on $l$ contract
# otherwise reduce coverage a bit and adjust premium such that $l$ type just prefers new contract; reap all profits from $l$ types without attracting $h$ types
- $l$ type is indifferent between his contract and $h$ contract
# otherwise, h strictly prefers his contract and I can offer contract with slightly higher coverage thanbefore to l such that l just prefers new contract and h does not while making positive profits; 

Results:
- equilibrium construction: 
  - $h$ gets contract where his zero profit line intersects full insurance
  - $l$ gets contract where his indifference curve through $h$'s contract intersects his zero profit line
- first best contract for $h$
- underinsurance for $l$

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (non-existence of equilibrium)
- if $\gamma$ small, there exists a pooling contract with positive profits from the above constructed equilibrium

- other equilibrium concepts for this case (Wilson 1977, Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence, 1978, Netzer and Scheuer 2014)

** Insurance monopolist (Stiglitz 1977)
- same model as Rothschild-Stiglitz but instead of many competing insurers only one profit maximizing insurer
- single crossing holds, $h$ has highe demand for insurance than $l$

Profit maximizing menu:
- no pooling
# if pooling than premium equals wtp of l and full coverage; better to offer slightly lower cov for l (note that slope indiff curve equals slope isoprofit curve at full cov in C,premium diagram) while higher premium for $h$
- full coverage for $h$
# otherwise moving along his indiff curve to full cov yields higher profit
- premium of $l$ equals his willingness to pay
# otherwise increasing both premia increases profits
- choose coverage of $l$ to maximize profits

Results:
- full coverage for $h$ but under-insurance for $l$
- zero benefit from insurance for $l$, positive benefit for $h$

** Insurance monopolist (Stiglitz 1977): Example

- $u(x)=-e^{-x}$, $W=2$, $L=1$, $\alpha_h=0.5$, $\alpha_l=0.25$
- let $C$ be indemnity for $l$
- what is $l$'s expected utility without insurance?
# -.25*e^{-1+0.2}-.75*e^{-2+.2*4}
- recall: $l$'s premium equals his willingness to pay; what is $l$'s wtp?
# .25*[(1-p+C)-.2*(1-p+C)^2]+.75*[(2-p)-0.2*(2-p)^2]=1.1

* Application: genetic tests

** Genetic tests: possible frameworks

- genetic tests can be used to determine risk (but usually not perfectly)
- what is the right regulatory framework:
  - private information: test results (if existing) are private information of insured
  - voluntary disclosure: test results can be presented to insurer but do not have to presented
  - mandatory disclosure: existing results have to be disclosed
  - laissez faire: insurers can (ut do not have to) require (additional) tests

** Genetic tests: how to think about risk
- two kind of risk:
  - risk of having bad genetics
  - risk of falling ill given your genetic predisposition
- without tests: 
  - combination of both risks is insured
- with tests:
  - only risk conditional on genetic disposition is insured
  - (risk averse!) consumer bears risk of bad genetic disposition 

** Genetic tests: (partial) misunderstandings
- "genetic tests make health insurance impossible because insurance is about unpredictable risks"
# genetic tests reduce risk but do not eliminate it; remaining risk can still be insured

- "accurately predicting risks will simplify the calculation of premia; that's great for insurers"
# if a consumer could verify that he has not undertaken any genetic test, the insurer would not require one but insure the "test taking risk" instead; in fact being unable to insure the "test taking risk" will eliminate the scope of insurance and therefore the business opportunities for insurers 

- "voluntary disclosure is best for consumers as they then can use the test to get a better insurance when the test is favorable and they simply do not use the test otherwise"
# unraveling: basically equivalent to mandatory disclosure; consumers loose the ability to insure "test taking risk"

** Genetic tests: trade-off
- make tests available to insurer
  - consumers bare risk of bad genetic test (double punishment in case of bad genetic disposition)
- keep tests private
  - increased adverse selection

** Genetic tests: some (in)efficiencies
- some risk factors can lead to prevention efforts and -- cheaper -- early treatment
- test taking is costly
  - tests for risk of untreatable diseases
# total waste: only leads to adverse selection and non-insurable test taking risk

** Genetic tests: models of endogenous information acquisition
- let genetic test results be private information
- insurer(s) offer menu of contracts
- consumer observes menu, then decides whether to spend money/effort on genetic test to get a better idea of his own risk, then decides which contract to buy

Results:
- the more the offered contracts differ, the higher the incentives to acquire information
- more similar contracts --> less informed consumers --> higher profits
- distort $h$ contract as well to make contracts more similar! (additional inefficiency)

* Aside: Premium risk
** Premium risk: basics
- premium (and coverage) can depend on information health insurer has
  - age, chronical illness, ZIP code etc.
- consumer faces risk of higher premium due to future change in characteristic
  - getting older, becoming chronically ill, moving to bad ZIP code etc. 

** Premium risk: simple model
- 2 periods
- risk of loss $L$ in period 1 is $\alpha_l$
- risk of loss $L$ in period 2 is 
  - $\alpha_l$ with probability \lambda
  - $\alpha_h>\alpha_l$ with probability 1-\lambda
- perfect competition of profit maximizing insurers
- period 2 risk type is observable in period 2 by everyone but not in period 1

Equilibrium:
- premium/coverage in period 1: 
# L\alpha_l, full: L
- premium/coverage in period for $\alpha_l$:
# L\alpha_l, full: L
- premium/coverage in period for $\alpha_h$:
# L\alpha_h, full: L

- risk averse consumer suffers from premium risk:
# $E(u) = u(W- \alpha_l L)+\lambda u(W- \alpha_l L)+(1-\lambda) u(W- \alpha_h L)< u(W- \alpha_l L)+ u(W- \lambda\alpha_l L-(1-\lambda)\alpha_h L)$ by $u''<0$

** Premium risk: Long term contracts
- insurance contract covering both periods at premium
  - premium in period 1: $\alpha_l L$
  - premium in period 2: $(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h) L$
- potential problems:
#  - low risks try to get out of contract in period 2, insurers try to dump high risks in period 2 (maybe low quality?), if tastes for insurers -- e.g. due to vertical integration -- no switch possible 

** Premium risk: Guaranteed renewal
- against an up front fee of $[(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h)-\alpha_l]L$ the insurer offers the option to renew contract at first period premium $\alpha_l L$
# similar to private health insurance in Germany

- potential problems:
#  - credit constraints (in particular as young might have low incomes), insurers try to dump high risks in period 2 (maybe low quality?), if tastes for insurers -- e.g. due to vertical integration -- no switch possible 

** Premium risk: premium insurance
- (other) insurers offer full insurance against health premium increase at price $[(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h)-\alpha_l]L$
- advantage over guaranteed renewal: 
# solve the switching problem and the bad incentives for insurers in period 2
- potential problems:
# credit constraints, collusion possibility between health insurer and consumer against premium risk insurer (e.g. additional inefficient benefits at higher premium)

** Premium risk: community rating
- regulation: all insured pay the same premium, $\alpha_l$ in period 1 and  $(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h) L$ in period 2, that must not depend on risk type
 - problem: 
# low risk types choose not to insure
- community rating + mandatory insurance 
  - problem: 
# insurers try not to enroll high risk consumers, (low risks may be forced against their will)
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment 
  - problem: 
# insurers exclude certain treatments to avoid high risk consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment + regulated coverage
  - problem: 
# "cream skimming", offer packages (or additional benefits) attractive for healthy consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + single payer (NHS, Scandinavia)
  - problem: 
# lack of competition tends to lead to inefficiencies; no differentiation though needs/preferences may be differentiated

- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + risk adjustment (Netherlands?)


** Risk adjustment
-  "cream skimming" as problem:
  - insurers avoid high cost consumers and try to attract low cost consumers (how?)
# in particular if insurers can choose coverage or add-on services on base package; but maybe even if not (stairs, advertising)
- risk adjustment tries to eliminate this incentive
  - internal transfer payments from insurance with low risk insured to insurances with high risk insured
  - risk estimates based on observable characteristics (gender, age, chronically ill etc.)
  - if well designed, transfer exactly compensates additional cost
  - level playing field --> more intense competition
  - risk factors should be outside of the control of the insurer to avoid manipulability
#  (problematic: lagged expenditures)

- problems of  community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + risk adjustment:
# how well does risk adjustment work?; no differentiation in package despite differentiated preferences; (what about "additional services", "bonus programs" etc.?)

** Risk adjustment: how good is prediction?

- 1997, 1998 data from large German insurer (800.000 insured)
- % of variance explained by the following covariates

* Selection emprically
** Empirics: Who has information? I
- adverse selection and the problem of premium risk only occur if consumer, respectively insurer, have information on health status they can use in decision making
#

- long term care insurance
- elderly sample (average age 78), US, 1995-2000
- 16% enter nursing home, 11% have long term care insurance
- survey in 1995 asks 
  - "Of course nobody wants to go to a nursing home, but sometimes it becomes necessary. What do you think are the chances that you will move to a nursing home in the next five years?"
  - average answer 18%

** Empirics: Who has information? II
- estimate model: prob(care)=f(a*X+c*Belief)

** Empirics: Explanations
- wealth
  - poorer people are covered by Medicaid --> buy less insurance
  - poorer people have higher risk
- "risk aversion"
  - risk averse people are more likely to buy insurance
  - risk averse people have lower risk

** Advantageous selection

- variable A is 
  - negatively correlated with risk
  - positively correlated with insurance purchase (or vice versa)
- can turn positive correlation between risk and insurance purchase around
  - people with lower risk buy insurance
  - "advantageous selection"
** Other observations:

- Hemenway reports on risk aversion
  - in a hospital 7% were uninsured but 46% of motorcyclists with accidents
  - another hospital: 27% of helmeted motorcyclists uninsured but 41% of unhelmeted
- prevention channel

- Fang, Keane and Silverman find negative correlation in medigap market and can attribute it to wealth and cognitive ability (not risk aversion)

** Advantageous selection: models I
- fixed coverage model
  - difference between demand and cost function captures risk premium
  - suppose higher cost consumers have low risk premium
  - order consumers according to (i) willingness to pay for insurance or (ii) expected costs
# ordering according to wtp/demand is not necessarily the same as ordering according to expected costs

** Advantageous selection: models II
- suppose two types
  - very risk averse and prob of loss $\alpha$
  - very little risk averse and prob of loss $\alpha+\varepsilon$
- if $\varepsilon$ is very small, how do indifference curve of the two types look like?
# single crossing but opposite from standard model
# for example in monopoly model, we can make a similar analysis as before but those with higher risk will then buy less coverage

- would mandating full insurance, as in many social health insurance systems, significantly increase welfare?
# no: those that are left with little/no insurance are close to risk neutral and therefore mandating insurance for them does not really improve welfare!

- is it reasonable that consumers with high expected costs are less risk averse in health insurance?
# problematic: poor people tend to have high risk and no insurance in the US, should we conclude that they are risk loving? Normally, 

** Wealth, risk and utilization I
- in the US, poor people have less insurance but worse health
- explaining this with advantageous selection, who would be more risk averse rich or poor?
# poor more risk averse, seems unlikely and counter to economic eperiments/data

# poor cannot afford copay and therefore do not utilize insurance; hence insurance has little value for them because it is not health but health care expenditure that is insured

** Wealth, risk and utilization III

# the richer, the more people spend on treatments etc.
- when falling ill insured chooses treatment intensity 

- $s\in[0,1]$ is health state
- $h$ is post treatment health and $h=s+\tau$ where $\tau\in[0,1-s]$ is treatment intensity
- consumption $c$ equals 
  - $W-p-(1-q)\tau$ (with prob $\alpha$) where $1-q$ is copayment rate (and $q$ is coverage) and $p$ is insurance premium

- assume utility function
$$v(c,h)=c-c^2/2+h-h^2/2$$

\tiny (let $W$ be small enough such that marginal utility from consumption is positive!)

** Wealth, risk and utilization IV
*** Optimal treatment
The utility maximizing treatment in state $s$ is
$$\tau^*(s)=\max\left\{0,\frac{1-s-(1-q)(1+p-W)}{(1-q)^2+1}\right\}.$$

- how does treatment intensity vary in wealth?
- how does the treatment intensity vary in coverage?
- what is the treatment intensity for full coverage?

** Wealth, risk and utilization V

- plug $\tau^*(s)$ into $v$ and compare slope of indifference curve across 2 types (coverage, premium diagram)
  - rich (high $W$), low risk (high $s$ more likely)
  - poor (low $W$), high risk (low $s$ more likely)
- which type is willing to pay more for increasing coverage from 99% to 100%?
# high risk type, as full treatment only prob of falling ill matters

- which type is willing to pay more for increasing coverage from 0% to 1%?
# poor guy might not buy treatment at all at these low coverage levels! hence, the rich is willing to pay more

- single crossing violated! 

[[https://github.com/schottmueller/infohealthecon/blob/master/julia/HealthInsuranceNoSingleCrossing.ipynb][jupyter notebook]]

** Wealth, risk and utilization VI

it can be shown that:
- poor, high risk type has weakly more coverage than rich, low risk type if the insurance market is perfectly competitive
- opposite might be true if insurances have market power (e.g. insurance monopoly)

- mandatory insurance can be welfare improving in second case
