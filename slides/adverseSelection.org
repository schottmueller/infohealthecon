* Adverse selection with fixed coverage
** Model
- fixed insurance contract, e.g. full coverage
- large heterogenous population: 
  - differ in willingness to pay for contract
  - differ in expected costs 
- heterogeneity is unobserved by insurers
- insurers set premium
- for now: insurances have no costs


*** Question 							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
- Who is likely to have a higher willingness to pay for insurance: those with low or high expected costs?

# willingness to pay: expected cost + risk premium

** Demand and marginal cost

# Figure 1 of E&F: downward sloping demand, MC and AC
# MC(0)=AC(0) 
# risk premium (abstracting from wealth effects): difference between demand and MC, positive as risk averse, i.e. D>MC
# 

** Competitive equilibrium

- if many insurers compete on premium, equilibrium premium equals average costs (Bertrand competition)
- possible inefficiency: too little insurance in equilibrium
# if AC curve intersects demand, then not everyone buys insurance and market equilibrium, i.e. most healthy do not although their willingness to pay is above MC; problem: if I want to attract marginal buyer I have to lower premium for all inframarginal buyers 

Result:
- adverse selection leads to too little insurance
- insurance mandate (?)
# what is the regulated premium? force people to buy insurance at premium above wtp?
- premium subsidy
# shifts demand up, reduces inefficiency (unless high shadow cost of public funds); imagine a head tax of $T$ that is then paid as a subsidy when buying insurance -> if T is high enough to get everyone to insure then everyone is better off unless there are administrative costs of taxation

** Special cases

- no inefficiency
# AC in between MC and D, never intersects D

- complete unravelling
# AC completely above demand (intersects demand and MC at Q=0)

** Gender specific premia

- suppose women tend to have lower expected costs than men
- who will have the lower premium, if insurance companies are allowed to discriminate based on gender?
- if insurance companies are prohibited to discriminate based on gender, who benefits? who loses?

# female premium is lower with discrimination; i.e. women lose from regulation and men gain and women will be more likely to uninsured with regulation while men are less likely to be uninsured

** Gender specific premia
- unisex tarif were introduced in the US in the 80s 
- Wall Street Journal (1987) reported the following changes in premia
  
|                  | women |  men |
|------------------+-------+------|
| /                |    <  |      |
| life insurance   |  +15% |  -3% |
| health insurance |  -13% | +28% |
| auto insurance   |  +49% | -16% |

** Loading factors
- insurance have administrative costs
- MC curve is expected payout + administrative costs of the contract
- admin cost shift MC up
- "loading": difference between premium and expected payout

Results:

- not necessarily optimal to insure everyone $\rightarrow$ insurance mandate not optimal
- effects of adverse selection as before (underinsurance in equilibrium)

** Evidence for selection
- recipients of Medicare can in many parts of the US choose between traditional plan and HMO plan (limited network and benefits)
  - expenditures 6 months before enrolling in HMO: 63\% of average
  - expenditures 6 months after disenrolling from HMO: 160% of average

- Ellis (1985) reports of an employer that switched from offering one insurance plan to offering 3 insurance plans with different coverage levels
  - employees choosing high coverage plan had four times as high expenditures than the one in the low coverage plan

* Screening

** Rothschild-Stiglitz Model (screening with perfect competition)

- consumers
  - two risk types: prob of loss either $\alpha_l$ or $\alpha_h>\alpha_l$
  - otherwise identical (utility function $u$ with $u'>0$ and $u''<0$, wealth $W$, loss $L$)
  - risk type is private information of consumer

- insurers
  - risk neutral
  - zero administrative costs
  - offer menus of coverage/premium pairs
  - many insurance companies
  - knows share of high risk type in population $\gamma\in(0,1)$

- equilibrium
  - system of contracts, i.e. coverage/premium pairs, such that no insurance can increase its profits by offering another contract or withdrawing a contract it offers

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: first best (no information asymmetry)

- benchmark: risk types are known by insurances
- what is equilibrium?

# full insurance, fig 5.3 on p.172 in ZBK
# or figure with coverage on x-axis and premium on y-axis
# high risk would like to choose low risk contract

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (no pooling)

- high risk type has higher demand for coverage
- single crossing: 
  - in $W_1$, $W_2$ diagram, $h$ has a flatter indifference curve than $l$
  - in coverage, premium diagram, $h$ has a steeper indifference curve
- pooling equilibrium: both risk types buy the same contract

Result:
- pooling equilibrium does not exist
# fig 5.4 on p. 174 in ZBK

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (separating equilibrium)
- one contract for each risk type and each prefers his contract
- as $h$ is more eager to buy insurance, he has more coverage (higher $W_2$, lower $W_1$) in equilibrium
- insurers make zero profit on $h$ contract
# otherwise compete by offering this contract at epsilon lower premium
- $h$ type has full insurance, $W_1=W_2$ in equilibrium
# otherwise offer full coverage where $h$ is indifferent and give him epsilon lower premium; as h is more eager than l, l will not buy new contract but as more cov is efficient it yields higher profits for epsilon small
- insurers make zero profits on $l$ contract
# otherwise reduce coverage a bit and adjust premium such that $l$ type just prefers new contract; reap all profits from $l$ types without attracting $h$ types
- $l$ type is indifferent between his contract and $h$ contract
# otherwise, h strictly prefers his contract and I can offer contract with slightly higher coverage thanbefore to l such that l just prefers new contract and h does not while making positive profits; 

Results:
- equilibrium construction: 
  - $h$ gets contract where his zero profit line intersects full insurance
  - $l$ gets contract where his indifference curve through $h$'s contract intersects his zero profit line
- first best contract for $h$
- underinsurance for $l$

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (non-existence of equilibrium)
- if $\gamma$ small, there exists a pooling contract with positive profits from the above constructed equilibrium

- other equilibrium concepts for this case (Wilson 1977, Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence, 1978, Netzer and Scheuer 201?)

** Insurance monopolist (Stiglitz 1977)
- same model as Rothschild-Stiglitz but instead of many competing insurers only one profit maximizing insurer
- single crossing holds, $h$ has highe demand for insurance than $l$

Profit maximizing menu:
- no pooling
# if pooling than premium equals wtp of l and full coverage; better to offer slightly lower cov for l (note that slope indiff curve equals slope isoprofit curve at full cov in C,premium diagram) while higher premium for $h$
- full coverage for $h$
# otherwise moving along his indiff curve to full cov yields higher profit
- premium of $l$ equals his willingness to pay
# otherwise increasing both premia increases profits
- choose coverage of $l$ to maximize profits

# maybe example

Results:
- full coverage for $h$ but under-insurance for $l$
- zero benefit from insurance for $l$, positive benefit for $h$

* Application: genetic tests

** Genetic tests: possible frameworks

- genetic tests can be used to determine risk (but usually not perfectly)
- what is the right regulatory framework:
  - private information: test results (if existing) are private information of insured
  - voluntary disclosure: tets results can be presented to insurer but do not have to presented
  - mandatory disclosure: existing results have to be disclosed
  - laissez faire: insurers can (ut do not have to) require (additional) tests

** Genetic tests: how to think about risk
- two kind of risk:
  - risk of having bad genetics
  - risk of falling ill given your genetic predisposition
- without tests: 
  - combination of both risk is insured
- with tests:
  - only risk conditional on genetic disposition is insured
  - (risk averse!) consumer bares risk of bad genetic disposition 

** Genetic tests: (partial) misunderstandings
- "genetic tests make health insurance impossible because insurance is about unpredictable risks"
# genetic tests reduce risk but do not eliminate it; remaining risk can still be insured

- "accurately predicting risks will simplify the calculation of premia; that's great for insurers"
# if a consumer could verify that he has not undertaken any genetic test, the insurer would not require one but insure the "test taking risk" instead; in fact being unable to insure the "test taking risk" will eliminate the scope of insurance and therefore the business opportunities for insurers 

- "voluntary disclosure is best for consumers as they then can use the test to get a better insurance when the test is favorable and they simply do not use the test otherwise"
# unraveling: basically equivalent to mandatory disclosure; consumers loose the ability to insure "test taking risk"

** Genetic tests: trade-off
- make tests available to insurer
  - consumers bare risk of bad genetic test (double punishment in case of bad genetic disposition)
- keep tests private
  - increased adverse selection

** Genetic tests: some (in)efficiencies
- some risk factors can lead to prevention efforts and -- cheaper -- early treatment
- test taking is costly
  - tests for risk of untreatable diseases
# total waste: only leads to adverse selection and non-insurable test taking risk

* Application: long run contracts
** Long run contracts: why?
Health insurance contracts in many countries are long term (explicitly or in practice); why?
# think of PKV in Germany
# - Otherwise, premia would be high in old age! (probably wrong, why?)
   # saving at young age possible as in PKV
# - Insuring the premium risk: When young you do not know which risk type you will be. By having a long term contract, one insures against type risk that realizes only over time.
#  --> why not a market for insuring against premium risk: potentially difficult: good risks may not buy insurance later to avoid paying into the premium insurance; life time premium cannot be paid by young due to credit constraint etc.; potentially no incentives for insurance to quote/determine "fitting" premium 
#  --> problems with this form of insurance: lock-in gives insurers incentives to lower quality 
# solutions in Germany: GKV has no premium risk as no risk-adjusted premium; PKV has saving model where in young years money is saved ot be used in old years to reduce/eliminate premium risk, fix quality problem by having minimum quality of GKV plus additional services

# maybe do more (example) as in Wambach slides

* Fostering selection: Cream skimming etc.  
** Risk adjustment
-  "cream skimming" as problem:
  - insurers avoid high cost consumers and try to attract low cost consumers (how?)
# in particular if insurers can choose coverage or add-on services on base package; but maybe even if not (stairs, advertising)
- risk adjustment tries to eliminate this incentive
  - internal transfer payments from insurance with low risk insured to insurances with high risk insured
  - risk estimates based on observable characteristics (gender, age, chronically ill etc.)
# Risikostrukturausgleich: also income as premium is income based
  - if well designed, transfer exactly compensates additional cost
  - risk factors should be outside of the control of the insurer to avoid manipulability (problematic: lagged expenditures)

** Risk adjustment: how good is prediction?

- 1997, 1998 data from large German insurer (800.000 insured)
- % of variance explained by the following covariates

|                                            | concurrent exp | prospective exp |
|--------------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------|
| /                                          |             <  |                 |
| age and gender                             |           3.2% |            3.2% |
| age, gender and invalid status             |           5.1% |            4.5% |
| above + hierarchical \\ coexisting conditions         |            37% | 12%             |

- from 1996 to 2001 German risk adjustment was based on age, gender, invalid and income
- since 2009, detailed system of hierarchical coexisting conditions

** "Solutions" to selection problems I
- community rating: premium must not depend on individual risk factors 
  - problem: low risk types choose not to insure
- community rating + mandatory insurance 
  - problem: insurers do not enroll high risk consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment 
  - problem: insurers exclude certain treatments to avoid high risk consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment + regulated coverage
  - problem: "cream skimming", offer packages (or additional benefits) attractive for healthy consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + single payer (NHS, DK)
  - problem: lack of competition tends to lead to inefficiencies; no differentiation though needs/preferences may be differentiated

** "Solutions" to selection problems II
- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + risk adjustment (Netherlands?)
  - problem: how well does risk adjustment work?; no differentiation in package despite differentiated preferences; (what about "additional services", "bonus programs" etc.?)
