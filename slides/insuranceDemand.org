* Gambles and utility functions
** Certainty equivalent
*** Example
Flip a fair coin: If heads you have 700\euro  as monthly income, if tails 1.500\euro. What is your expected income? \linebreak If you could get X\euro  for sure as income, how high has X to be to make you indifferent to the lottery?

*** Certainty equivalent				       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
Take a lottery $L$. The /certainty equivalent/ of $L$ is the amount $X$ such that the individual is indifferent between  the lottery and receiving $X$ for sure.

$$u(CE)=\text{expected utility of lottery}$$
** Risk premium
*** Example (continued)
Flip a fair coin: If heads you have 700\euro  as monthly income, if tails 1.500\euro. What is your expected income? \linebreak How much expected income are you willing to sacrifice in order to avoid risk?

*** Risk premium					       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
The /risk premium/ is the difference between the expected payout in a lottery $L$ and the certainty equivalent of this lottery.

$$\text{risk premium} = \text{expected wealth in lottery} - \text{certainty equivalent}$$

# risk premium ~ willingness to pay for insurance

*** :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
note: 

expected utility of lottery = u(expected wealth of lottery - risk premium)

** Plotting your utility function
# - assign arbitrary numbers as $u(10.000)$ and $u(20.000)$, put them in diagram
# - put (CE,0.5*u(10.000)+0.5*u(20.000)) in diagram
# - consider more lotteries/probabilities and put more points

* Drivers of insurance demand

** The simple standard model of insurance demand
- person has wealth $W$
- monetary loss $L$ with probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$
- person maximizes expected utility $$(1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L)$$ where $u$ is a strictly increasing function (with inverse function $u^{-1}$)

\vspace*{1cm}
- what is the expected wealth of the person?
- what is the formula for the certainty equivalent and the risk premium?
- how could we interpret the loss $L$ in the context of health insurance?

# prob of falling ill and then treatment cost L or health loss hurts as much as a wealth loss of L or combination of the two

** Risk aversion

*** Risk aversion					       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
A person is /risk averse/ if the risk premium is non-negative for all lotteries.

*** 							    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

- a person is risk averse if and only if his utility function is concave

# more risk averse -> higher risk premium, higher wtp for insurance; concave transformation of u that leaves u(W) and u(W-L) the same clearly increases risk premium

** Aside: Implicit function theorem
*** Implicit function theorem
Let the function $C(L)$ be implicitly defined by the equation 
$$F(C,L)=0$$
where $F$ is a continuously differentiable function. Then,
$$C'(L)=-\frac{\partial F/\partial L}{\partial F/\partial C}$$
at all points where $\partial F/\partial C\neq 0$.

*** IFT :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
$3C-4L=0$ implicitly defines the function 
$$C(L)=$$
Check $C'(L)$ according to IFT and by directly differentiating $C(L)$.

** Size of the loss
- consider a wealth of W and a potential loss of $L\in(0,W)$ that occurs with probability $\alpha$
*** Size of the loss						  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
If a person is risk averse, the risk premium is increasing in $L$.

*** 							    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
# Proof: $CE(L)=u^{-1}\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)$ and $CE'(L)=\frac{-\alpha u'(W-L)}{u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)}$ which is in absolute value greater than \alpha by concavity of $u$. Now $RP(L)=W-\alpha L-CE(L)$ and therefore $RP'(L)=-\alpha-CE'(L)>0$.

# insurance is most valuable for big losses, e.g. only for big enough losses RP is higher than handling cost of insurance, (coverage for hospital is more important than for GP)

** Probability of loss

*** Probability of the loss					  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
If a person is risk averse, the risk premium is first increasing in $\alpha$ (when $\alpha$ is small) and then decreasing in $\alpha$ (when $\alpha$ is large).

*** 							    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:

# Proof:  $CE(\alpha)=u^{-1}\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)$ and $CE'(\alpha)=\frac{-u(W)+u(W-L)}{u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)}$ which is negative. Now $RP(\alpha)=W-\alpha L-CE(\alpha)$ and therefore $RP'(\alpha)=-L-CE'(\alpha)=\frac{1}{u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)}\left( u(W)-u(W-L)-L u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right) \right)$. By concavity, this difference is positive for small \ælpha and negative for large \alpha. (draw concave function)

# graphical proof: draw concave u(x) and line through u(W) and u(W-L), visualize RP for different levels of \alpha 

# do not insure certain events but uncertain events

** Wealth effect

*** Wealth effect						  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
If a person is risk averse, the effect of $W$ on the risk premium is ambiguous. If the person becomes less risk averse as income increases -- in the sense that $u'''\geq0$ -- then a higher $W$ leads to a lower risk premium.

# Proof: $CE(W)=u^{-1}\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)$ and $CE'(W)=\frac{(1-\alpha) u'(W)+\alpha u'(W-L)}{u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)}$. As $u'$ is convex by $u'''>0$, it holds that $(1-\alpha) u'(W)+\alpha u'(W-L)\geq u'\left( (1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(W-L) \right)$ and therefore $CE'(W)\geq 1$. Now $RP(W)=W-\alpha L-CE(W)$ and therefore $RP'(W)=1-CE'(W)\leq0$. 

# question is whether you get less or more risk averse as you get richer; most people think less and then poor people have a higher demand for insurance than rich people

** Access motive

- think of catastrophes: 
   - probability of an illness $\alpha$ is small 
   - costs of treatment $L$ are higher than $W$
   - death without treatment

# if $\alpha L< W$, then an insurance at premium $\alpha L$ is possible and gives access to treatment in case of illness
* Choosing coverage
** Choosing coverage
- loss of $L$ with probability $\alpha$ from wealth $W$
- insurance covers $C$ at premium $pC$ and insuree chooses $C$
- $u'>0$, $u''<0$
 $$E[u]=(1-\alpha)u(W-pC)+\alpha u(W-pC-L+C)$$
- let $W_1=W-pC$ and $W_2=W-pC-L+C$

    :END:
The optimal decision $C^*$ leads to 
$$-\frac{(1-\alpha)u'(W_1^*)}{\alpha u'(W_2^*)}=-\frac{1-p  }{p}$$
# in W_1 W_2 diagram slope of budget line equals slope of indif curve (increasing C by one marginal unit reduces W_1 by p and increases W_2 by 1-p)
$$\Leftrightarrow \frac{u'(W_1^*)}{ u'(W_2^*)}=\frac{\alpha(1-p)}{(1-\alpha)p}$$

Results:
\vspace*{-0.1cm}
- fair insurance ($p=\alpha$): demand full coverage
- "unfair" insurance ($p>\alpha$): demand partial coverage

** Effects of minimum income/treatment 
- suppose government guarantees income $\underline{W}>W-L$ 
- new option: $W_1=W$ and $W_2=\underline{W}$ (no insurance)
- no insurance is chosen if $(1-\alpha)u(W_1^*)+\alpha u(W_2^*)<(1-\alpha)u(W)+\alpha u(\underline W)$, i.e. if $\underline W$ is sufficiently high

Results:
- government guarantees crowd out insurance
- insurance mandate necessary (?)

# when drought in 2018 in Germany only 0.5% of agricult. area was insured against drought but 72% against hail; after the 2018 drought they received 340 Million € in government aid

** State dependent preferences
- when you are ill, you do not enjoy consumption a lot:
  - utility ill $u_i$, utility healthy $u_h$
  - $u'_i<u'_h$
- assume fair premium, then
$$E[u]=(1-\alpha)u_h(W-\alpha C)+\alpha u_i(W-\alpha C-L+C)$$

    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
Optimal coverage with state dependent utility, $C^*$, is characterized by 
$$u'_h(W-\alpha C^*)=u_i'(W-L-\alpha C^*+C^*)$$
and therefore $C^*<L$.

    :END:
Result:
- partial/less coverage if consumption is less attractive in ill state
