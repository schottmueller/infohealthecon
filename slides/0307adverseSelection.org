* Adverse selection with fixed coverage

# show in model that wtp for insurance increases in risk of accident p or loss L
# reminder on demand curve as smooth version of wtp curve
# additional application? check paper

** Model
- fixed insurance contract, e.g. full coverage
- large heterogeneous population: 
  - differ in willingness to pay for contract
  - differ in expected costs 
- heterogeneity is unobserved by insurers \linebreak (expected costs and willingness to pay are "private information of consumers")
- insurers set premium
- for now: insurances have no administrative costs 


*** Question 							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
- Who is likely to have a higher willingness to pay for insurance: those with low or high expected costs?

# willingness to pay: expected cost + risk premium

** Demand and marginal cost

# Figure 1 of E&F: downward sloping demand, MC and AC
# MC(0)=AC(0) 
# risk premium (abstracting from wealth effects): difference between demand and MC, positive as risk averse, i.e. D>MC -> efficient that everyone is insured
# downward sloping MC implies AC>MC and therefore intersection of D and AC is (if it exists) at Q below efficient level
# difference to other goods (cars etc.): costs are linked to wtp

** Competitive equilibrium I
   - "equilibrium":
     - no market participant wants to change his behavior (stability)
     - outside prediction of market outcome with rational market participants
   - consumers buy at the lowest offered premium and only if this premium is below WTP
   - lowest offered premium has to /be equal or above/ average costs of those consumers that buy\linebreak (otherwise selling insurance company makes losses and would rather not sell)
   - lowest offered premium has to be /equal or below/ average costs of those consumers that buy\linebreak
     (otherwise an insurance company could increase its profits by slightly undercutting)

** Competitive equilibrium II
- if many insurers compete on premium, equilibrium premium equals average costs ("Bertrand competition" or "perfect competition")
$$p^* = AC_{\text{buying consumers}}$$
- possible inefficiency: too little insurance in equilibrium
# if AC curve intersects demand, then not everyone buys insurance and market equilibrium, i.e. most healthy do not although their willingness to pay is above MC; problem: if I want to attract marginal buyer I have to lower premium for all inframarginal buyers, i.e. equilibrium determined by AC while efficiency is determined by MC

Result:
- adverse selection leads to too little insurance
- insurance mandate (?)
# what is the regulated premium? force people to buy insurance at premium above wtp?
- premium subsidy
# shifts demand up, reduces inefficiency (unless high shadow cost of public funds); imagine a head tax of $T$ that is then paid as a subsidy when buying insurance -> increases insurance and efficiency if no (admin) costs of taxation but note that low risk consumers

** Special cases

- no inefficiency
# AC in between MC and D, never intersects D

- complete unravelling
# AC completely above demand (intersects demand and MC at Q=0)

** Gender specific premia

- suppose women tend to have lower expected costs than men
  - who will have the lower premium, if insurance companies are allowed to discriminate based on gender?
  - if insurance companies are prohibited to discriminate based on gender, who benefits? who loses?
  - does discrimination lead to a more or less efficient outcome?

# female premium is lower with discrimination; i.e. women lose from regulation and men gain and women will be more likely to be uninsured with regulation while men are less likely to be uninsured
# depends: if all group memebers are homogenous, than discrimination leads to efficient outcome; if not, unisex tarifs may be more efficient in the light of adverse selection, e.g.
# |     | male 1 | male 2 | female |
# |-----+--------+--------+--------|
# | wtp |     10 |      5 |      5 |
# | mc  |      8 |      3 |      3 |
# unisex leads to insurance for everyone at price equals AC=14/3<5 while discrimination leads to inefficiency in the male market as p=8 and only male 1 is insured in eq

** Gender specific premia
- unisex tarif were introduced in Montana, US in 1983 by law 
- Wall Street Journal (1987) reported the following changes in premia
  
|                  | women |  men |
|------------------+-------+------|
| /                |     < |      |
| life insurance   |  +15% |  -3% |
| health insurance |  -13% | +28% |
| car insurance    |  +49% | -16% |


# whether non-discrimination clauses in- or decrease welfare depends: if no asym info left, i.e. groups are homogenous like all men/women have same risk, then efficient to discriminate as MC curve flat. Example for non-discrimination efficient: man 1: WTP=10, MC=8; man 2: WTP=5, MC=3; woman: WTP=5, MC=3; non-disc eq is that p=14/3<5 and all are insured but the equilibrium for the men group is p=8 and only man 1 is insured.

** Loading factors
- insurance companies have administrative costs
- MC curve is expected payout + administrative costs of the contract
- admin costs shift MC up
- "loading": difference between premium and expected payout

Results:

- not necessarily optimal to insure everyone $\rightarrow$ insurance mandate not optimal
- effects of adverse selection as before (underinsurance in equilibrium)

** Evidence for self selection
- recipients of Medicare can in many parts of the US choose between traditional plan and HMO plan (limited network and benefits)
  - expenditures 6 months before enrolling in HMO: 63% of average
  - expenditures 6 months after disenrolling from HMO: 160% of average

- Ellis (1985) reports of an employer that switched from offering one insurance plan to offering 3 insurance plans with different coverage levels
  - employees choosing high coverage plan had four times as high expenditures than the one in the low coverage plan

* Screening with coverage: Rothschild-Stiglitz

** Rothschild-Stiglitz Model (screening with perfect competition)

- consumers
  - two risk types: prob of loss either $\alpha_l$ or $\alpha_h>\alpha_l$
  - otherwise identical (utility function $u$ with $u'>0$ and $u''<0$, wealth $W$, loss $L$)
  - risk type is private information of consumer

- insurers
  - risk neutral (i.e maximize expected profits)
  - zero administrative costs
  - offer menus of coverage/premium pairs
  - many insurance companies
  - know share of high risk type in population $\gamma\in(0,1)$

** Rothschild-Stiglitz equilibrium
system of contracts, i.e. coverage/premium pairs, such that 
  1. every offered contract yields non-negative expected profits, 
  2. no insurance can increase its expected profits by offering another contract,
  3. consumers maximize expected utility. 

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: first best (no information asymmetry)

- benchmark: risk types are known by insurances
- what is equilibrium?

# see next slides
# full insurance, fig 5.3 on p.172 in ZBK
# or figure with coverage on x-axis and premium on y-axis
# high risk would like to choose low risk contract

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: curves and slopes I
Aside: 
\vspace*{-0.1cm}
*** Implicit function theorem
Let the function $p(q)$ be implicitly defined by the equation 
$$F(p,q)=0$$
where $F$ is a continuously differentiable function. Then,
$$p'(q)=-\frac{\partial F/\partial q}{\partial F/\partial p}$$
at all points where $\partial F/\partial p\neq 0$.

*** IFT :B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:
$3p-4q=0$ implicitly defines the function 
$$p(q)=$$
Check $p'(q)$ according to IFT and by directly differentiating $p(q)$.

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: curves and slopes II
- /iso-profit curve/ for profit level $\bar\pi$
  - all $(q,p)$ combination leading to profit $\bar\pi$
  - profits: $\pi=p-\alpha q L$
  - iso- profit: $p(q|\pi=\bar \pi)=\bar\pi+\alpha q L$ with slope $\alpha L$ 
- /indifference curve/ for expected utility $\bar u$
  - all $(q,p)$ combinations leading to expected utility $\bar u$
  - exp. utility: $\mathbb{E}[u]=\alpha u(W-p-(1-q)L)+(1-\alpha) u(W-p)$
  - slope indifference curve via implicit function theorem:
$$p'(q|\mathbb{E}[u]=\bar u)=\alpha L\frac{u'(W-p-(1-q)L)}{\alpha u'(W-p-(1-q)L)+(1-\alpha)u'(W-p)}\geq\alpha L$$
for $q\leq1$ (with strict inequality if $q<1$) and rearranging gives 
$$p'(q|\mathbb{E}[u]=\bar u)= L\frac{u'(W-p-(1-q)L)}{u'(W-p-(1-q)L)+\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}u'(W-p)}$$
and therefore slope indifference curve higher for higher \alpha
** Rothschild-Stiglitz: curves and slopes III
important features to remember:
- through a $(q,p)$ point the slope $p'(q)$ of the indifference curve is higher for higher risk types
- for $q<1$: through a $(q,p)$ point the slope $p'(q)$ of the indifference curve of type $\alpha$ is higher than the slope of the isoprofit line of type $\alpha$
- for $q=1$: through a $(q,p)$ point the slope $p'(q)$ of the indifference curve of type $\alpha$ equals the slope of the isoprofit line of type $\alpha$

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (no pooling)

- high risk type has higher demand for coverage
- single crossing: 
  - in coverage, premium diagram, $h$ has a steeper indifference curve
- pooling equilibrium: both risk types buy the same contract

Result:
- pooling equilibrium does not exist
# fig 5.4 on p. 174 in ZBK

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (separating equilibrium)
- one contract for each risk type and each prefers his contract
# - as $h$ is more eager to buy insurance, he has more coverage (higher $q$) in equilibrium
# - insurers make zero profit on $h$ contract
# otherwise compete by offering this contract at epsilon lower premium
# - $h$ type has full insurance, i.e. $q^h=1$ or $W_1=W_2$ in equilibrium
# otherwise offer full coverage where $h$ is indifferent and give him epsilon lower premium; as h is more eager than l, l will not buy new contract but as more cov is efficient it yields higher profits for epsilon small
# - insurers make zero profits on $l$ contract
# otherwise reduce coverage a bit and adjust premium such that $l$ type just prefers new contract; reap all profits from $l$ types without attracting $h$ types
# - $h$ type is indifferent between his contract and $l$'s contract
# otherwise, (recall zero profits from previous point) I can increase coverage and premium a bit making pos profit and l-type better off without attracting h type as indiff l is steeper than isoprofit curve l 

- properties in a separating equilibrium:
  - as $h$ is more eager to buy insurance, he has more coverage (higher $q$) in equilibrium
  - competition leads to zero profits

Results:
- equilibrium construction: 
  - $h$ gets contract where his zero profit line intersects full insurance
  - $l$ gets contract where $h$'s indifference curve through $h$'s contract intersects $l$'s zero profit line
- first best contract for $h$
- underinsurance for $l$

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: second best (non-existence of equilibrium)
- if $\gamma$ small, there exists a pooling contract with positive profits from the above constructed "equilibrium"\linebreak $\rightarrow$ no equilibrium exists in this case

- other equilibrium concepts for this case (Wilson 1977, Miyazaki 1977, Spence 1978, Netzer and Scheuer 2014)

** Rothschild-Stiglitz: minimum coverage level
 - suppose a law makes it impossible to offer coverage below some threshold $\bar{q}$
 - how does this affect equilibrium?
# if \bar q below q_l^* , no effect
# if \bar q > q_l^* and RS eq existed and \bar q not too big, then new eq with same contract for h and (p,\bar q) where p is on h's indiff curve; note that this is not Pareto improvement as l is worse off (his indiff is flatter than h's) but positive profits from l type
# if \bar q too high, then no RS eq exists as potential eq (see above) is broken by pooling


* Application: genetic tests

** Genetic tests: possible regulatory frameworks

- genetic tests can be used to determine risk (but usually not perfectly)
- what is the right regulatory framework:
  - private information: test results (if existing) are private information of insured (and insurance policies cannot depend on them)
  - voluntary disclosure: test results can be presented to insurer but do not have to be presented
  - mandatory disclosure: existing results have to be disclosed
  - laissez faire: insurers can (but do not have to) require (additional) tests

** Genetic tests: model
model:
- same as Rothschild-Stiglitz but without test consumers do not know their risk type and have an average type $\bar\alpha=\gamma\alpha_h+(1-\gamma)\alpha_l$

\vspace*{1cm}

equilibria under different scenarios:
1. benchmark: test is impossible  \vspace*{0.5cm}
2. everyone is tested and results are disclosed to insurers (mandatory disclosure) \vspace*{0.5cm}
3. everyone is tested and results are private \vspace*{0.5cm}

# full coverage at p=\bar\alpha L
# full coverage at p=\alpha_i L
# RS equilibrium

# 2>3: same contract for $\alpha_H$ in (2) and (3) but l is worse off in RS

** Genetic tests: how to think about risk
- two kind of risk:
  - risk of having bad genetics
  - risk of falling ill given your genetic predisposition
- without tests: 
  - combination of both risks is insured
- with tests:
  - only risk conditional on genetic disposition is insured
  - (risk averse!) consumer bears risk of bad genetic disposition 

** Genetic tests: (partial) misunderstandings
- "genetic tests make health insurance impossible because insurance is about unpredictable risks"
# genetic tests reduce risk but do not eliminate it; remaining risk can still be insured

- "accurately predicting risks will simplify the calculation of premia; that's great for insurers"
# if a consumer could verify that he has not undertaken any genetic test, the insurer would not require one but insure the "test taking risk" instead; in fact being unable to insure the "test taking risk" will eliminate the scope of insurance and therefore the business opportunities for insurers 

- "voluntary disclosure is best for consumers as they then can use the test to get a better insurance when the test is favorable and they simply do not use the test otherwise"
# unraveling: basically equivalent to mandatory disclosure; consumers loose the ability to insure "test taking risk"

** Genetic tests: trade-off (?)
- make tests available to insurer
  - consumers bare risk of bad genetic test (double punishment in case of bad genetic disposition)
- keep tests private
  - increased adverse selection

** Genetic tests: some (in)efficiencies
- some risk factors can lead to prevention efforts or -- cheaper -- early treatment
- test taking is costly
  - tests for risk of untreatable diseases
# total waste: only leads to adverse selection and non-insurable test taking risk

** Genetic tests: models of endogenous information acquisition I
- suppose consumers decide themselves whether to take test at cost $c\geq 0$ and afterwards choose an insurance contract (or stay uninsured)
- insurers cannot verify whether consumer did (not) take a test

- equilibria in different scenarios
  1. $c=0$ and private information \vspace*{0.5cm}
  2. $c=0$ and voluntary disclosure \vspace*{0.5cm}
  3. $c>0$ and voluntary disclosure \vspace*{0.5cm}
  4. $c>0$ and private information \vspace*{0.5cm}

# 1: acquire info and RS-equilibrium 
# 2: everyone is tested and discloses, p_i=\alpha_i L and q_i=1

# 3: if c is low everyone is tested, p_i=\alpha_i L and q_i=1; if c is high no testing and p=\bar \alpha L, q=1. In detail: the first eq exists if $c\leq (1-\gamma)(\alpha_h-\alpha_l)L and the second eq exists if c\geq (1-\gamma)(\bar \alpha-\alpha_l)L

# 4: no equilibrium in which consumers get informed as it is better to buy the low coverage RS contract while remaining untested (high type is indifferent in RS, i.e. one simply saves c!); whether equilibrium exists in which no one gets informed depends on parameters: if $c$ is small this is not the case, because an insurer could offer a partial coverage deviation contract that is better than (\bar\alpha L,1) for l types (and worse for \bar \alpha types) that makes positive profits when bought by l-types. 
# Doherty and Thistle show that this non-existence is an artifact of the simplifications the model makes, i.e. equilibrium exists if we allow two groups of consumers that differ in their ex ante probability of being high risk (and privately know this). In this equilibrium some consumers get tested and others remain uninformed and three contracts are offered in equilibrium.

** Genetic tests: models of endogenous information acquisition II
- let genetic test results be private information
- insurer(s) offer menu of contracts
- consumer observes menu, then decides /how much/  money/effort to spend on genetic tests to get a better idea of his own risk, then decides which contract to buy

Results:
- the more the offered contracts differ, the higher the incentives to acquire information
- more similar contracts $\rightarrow$ less informed consumers $\rightarrow$ higher profits
- distort $h$ contract as well to make contracts more similar! (additional inefficiency)

* Premium risk, community rating and risk adjustment
** Premium risk: basics
- premium (and coverage) can depend on information health insurer has
  - age, chronical illness, ZIP code etc.
- consumer faces risk of higher premium due to future change in characteristic
  - getting older, becoming chronically ill, moving to bad ZIP code etc. 

** Premium risk: simple model
- 2 periods
- risk of loss $L$ in period 1 is $\alpha_l$
- risk of loss $L$ in period 2 is 
  - $\alpha_l$ with probability \lambda
  - $\alpha_h>\alpha_l$ with probability 1-\lambda
- perfect competition of profit maximizing insurers
- period 2 risk type is observable in period 2 by everyone but not in period 1

Equilibrium:
- premium/coverage in period 1: 
# L\alpha_l, full: L
- premium/coverage in period 2 for $\alpha_l$:
# L\alpha_l, full: L
- premium/coverage in period 2 for $\alpha_h$:
# L\alpha_h, full: L

- risk averse consumer suffers from premium risk:
# $E(u) = u(W- \alpha_l L)+\lambda u(W- \alpha_l L)+(1-\lambda) u(W- \alpha_h L)< u(W- \alpha_l L)+ u(W- \lambda\alpha_l L-(1-\lambda)\alpha_h L)$ by $u''<0$

** Premium risk: Long term contracts
- insurance contract covering both periods at prespecified premium
  - premium in period 1: $\alpha_l L$
  - premium in period 2: $(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h) L$
- potential problems:
#  - low risks try to get out of contract in period 2, insurers try to dump high risks in period 2 (maybe low quality?), if tastes for insurers -- e.g. due to vertical integration -- no switch possible 

** Premium risk: Guaranteed renewal
- against an up front fee of $[(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h)-\alpha_l]L$ the insurer offers the option to renew contract at first period premium $\alpha_l L$
# similar to private health insurance in Germany

- potential problems:
#  - credit constraints (in particular as young might have low incomes), insurers try to dump high risks in period 2 (maybe low quality?), if tastes for insurers -- e.g. due to vertical integration -- no switch possible 

** Premium risk: premium insurance
- (other) insurers offer full insurance against health premium increase at price $[(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h)-\alpha_l]L$
- advantage over guaranteed renewal: 
# solve the switching problem and the bad incentives for insurers in period 2
- potential problems:
# credit constraints, collusion possibility between health insurer and consumer against premium risk insurer (e.g. additional inefficient benefits at higher premium)

** Premium risk: community rating
- regulation: all insured pay the same premium, $\alpha_l L$ in period 1 and  $(\lambda\alpha_l+(1-\lambda)\alpha_h) L$ in period 2, that must not depend on risk type
 - problem: 
# low risk types choose not to insure
- community rating + mandatory insurance 
  - problem: 
# insurers try not to enroll high risk consumers, (low risks may be forced against their will)
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment 
  - problem: 
# insurers exclude certain treatments to avoid high risk consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + open enrollment + regulated coverage
  - problem: 
# "cream skimming", offer packages (or additional benefits) attractive for healthy consumers
- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + single payer (NHS, Scandinavia)
  - problem: 
# lack of competition tends to lead to inefficiencies; no differentiation though needs/preferences may be differentiated

- community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + risk adjustment (Netherlands?)


** Risk adjustment
-  "cream skimming" as problem:
  - insurers avoid high cost consumers and try to attract low cost consumers (how?)
# in particular if insurers can choose coverage or add-on services on base package; but maybe even if not (stairs, advertising)
- risk adjustment tries to eliminate this incentive
  - internal transfer payments from insurances with low risk insured to insurances with high risk insured
  - risk estimates based on observable characteristics (gender, age, chronically ill etc.)
  - if well designed, transfer exactly compensates additional cost
  - level playing field \rightarrow more intense competition
  - risk factors should be outside of the control of the insurer to avoid manipulability
#  (problematic: lagged expenditures)

- problems of  community rating + mandatory insurance + regulated coverage + open enrollment + risk adjustment:
# how well does risk adjustment work?; no differentiation in package despite differentiated preferences; (what about "additional services", "bonus programs" etc.?)

** Risk adjustment: how good is prediction?

*  Advantageous selection
** Empirics
- adverse selection requires that consumer has and uses information about his health status that the insurer does not have
- (premium risk required insurer to  have and use information on consumer's health status)
#

- long term care insurance
- elderly sample (average age 78), US, 1995-2000
- 16% enter nursing home, 11% have long term care insurance
- survey in 1995 asks 
  - "Of course nobody wants to go to a nursing home, but sometimes it becomes necessary. What do you think are the chances that you will move to a nursing home in the next five years?"
  - average answer 18%

# ** Empirics: Who has information? II
# - estimate model: prob(care)=f(a*X+c*Belief)

# interpretation: 10% higher belief to get into NH tends to lead to 0.91% higher prob of using NH
# insurance prediction is better than individual but (!) residual asym info
# likely underestimate as people report round numbers in their beliefs which possibly introduces noise

# ** Empirics: Information is used in insurance decision
# - estimate model: prob(insurance)=f(a*X+c*Belief)



# insurance could better predict risk if using all information but will not manage to reduce residual private info


# ** Empirics: correlation between insurance and care


# first: correlation of residuals from (i) probit LTCINS on X (ii) probit CARE on X --> expected positive correlation from BELIEF but 0 correlation!
# second: probit CARE on X and LTCINS --> expect pos corr through belief channel bit 0!

# - what is going on here?

# ** Empirics: Other covariates

# belief does not fully capture all information about likely use privately known to consumer (not fully complete updating: otherwise risk aversion measures should not be significant for NH Entry after controlling for BELIEF)
# wealth: Medicaid covers NH costs only if all wealth is exhausted --> poor individuals have implicit insurance through Medicaid that is less relevant for wealthy people --> wealthy people have higher demand for insurance; however, wealthy people have lower risk of NH entry (part of it could also be moral hazard, i.e. uninsured rich people avoiding NH entry where poor go to NH and let Medicaid pay)
# preventive health activity: mammogram, blood tests, prostate screen and few others
# these result predict negative correlation between LTC  and NH which cancels out positive expected correlation from adverse selection

** Empirics: Explanations
- wealth
  - poorer people are covered by Medicaid --> buy less insurance
  - poorer people have higher risk
- "risk aversion"
  - risk averse people are more likely to buy insurance
  - risk averse people have lower risk

** Advantageous selection

- variable A is 
  - negatively correlated with risk
  - positively correlated with insurance purchase (or vice versa)
- can turn positive correlation between risk and insurance purchase around
  - people with lower risk buy insurance
  - "advantageous selection"
** Other observations:

- Hemenway reports on risk aversion
  - in a hospital 7% were uninsured but 46% of motorcyclists with accidents
  - another hospital: 27% of helmeted motorcyclists uninsured but 41% of unhelmeted
- prevention channel

- Fang, Keane and Silverman find negative correlation in medigap market and can attribute it to wealth and cognitive ability (not risk aversion)

** Advantageous selection: model with fixed coverage
Fixed coverage model:
  - difference between demand and cost function captures risk premium
  - suppose higher cost consumers have low risk premium
  - order consumers according to (i) willingness to pay for insurance or (ii) expected costs
# ordering according to wtp/demand is not necessarily the same as ordering according to expected costs
