* The slope of demand
** How does health care demand vary in the price the patient has to pay?
a higher price (i.e. less insurance)... 
1. ...does not affect the amount of health care a patient consumes
2. ...reduces the amount of health care a patient consumes
3. ...increases the amount of health care a patient consumes

How do you design a study that settles the argument?

# ** Demand in a simple model

# - derive demand in a standard 101 micro model and show it is decreasing in price


* Field experimental evidence

** RAND health insurance experiment I
- 70s in the US
- 2000 families
- randomly assigned plans differing in copay and stop-loss

- rough price elasticity estimate: -0.2

** Oregon I

- Medicaid expansion in Oregon (2008)
- medium-low income 
- due to limited budget, lottery for eligibility
- no copayment, no premium
- use lottery success as instrument for health insurance
- compare people who won in lottery to those who did not

** Oregon II

- increase in health care spending due to Medicaid roughly 775$ per year (approx. 25%)

* The donut hole

** The donut hole I

- Medicare Part D provides coverage for elderly for medication

How will the distribution of medication expenditure for Medicare recipients look like?

* Welfare and moral hazard
** Welfare 
- why is "moral hazard" actually a problem?

# deadweight loss in demand diagram

* Structural estimation
** Out of sample predictions

- A health insurer considers to introduce a copayment of 10% up to 5000€ and asks you how this will affect expenditures. What do you do?

# price elasticity of -0.2, hence share of people with expenditures below 5000 are expected to consume 2% less

# simple structural model, e.g. u_i=-(\theta-h)^2 +m, before change, i.e.  without copayment, everyone chooses h=\theta, this gives the distribution of h; under the new regime u_i is -(\theta-h)^2+m-0.1h if h is less than 5000, determine which h everyone will choose now

* Ex ante moral hazard
** Ex ante moral hazard
- what is the impact of insurance on preventive behavior, life style etc.?
#

- uninsured in the US who become eligible for Medicare when turning 65

Results: after turning 65...
- number of physician visits increases for low-educated by 35 (41)% for men (wome)
- probability of engaging in vigorous physical activity falls by 21 (13)%

* Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts
** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: model
how does moral hazard affect optimal insurance contracts?
- loss equivalent to monetary loss of $L$ occurs with prob \alpha
- if loss occurs, consumer chooses medical spending $M\in[0,\bar M]$ to mitigate the loss to $L-f(M)$ 
  - assumptions: $f'>0$, $f''<0$, $f'(0)>1$, $f'(\bar M)<1$, $f(\bar M)\leq L$
- insurance costs premium $p$ and bares fraction $c$ of the medical spending
- simplifying assumption: fair premium, i.e. $p=\alpha cM^*$, were $M^*$ is optimal sepnding by the consumer
- what is the coverage level maximizing expected consumer utility?

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: analysis
- expected utility
$$ E[u] = (1-\alpha) u(W-p)+\alpha u(W-p-L-(1-c)M+f(M))$$
- consumer's optimal spending decision in case of loss:
# f'(M^*)=1-c, 
- how does $M^*$ react to $c$?
# higher c means higher M^* by f''<0; in fact dM^*/dc=-1/f''(M^*) 
- optimal choice of coverage

\small
$$ \max_{c\in[0,1]} (1-\alpha) u(W-\alpha cM^*(c))+\alpha u(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))$$

$$ \max_{c\in[0,1]} (1-\alpha) u(W-\alpha cM^*(c))+\alpha u(W-L+(1-\alpha)cM^*(c)-M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))$$

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: analysis

 first order condition: 
\tiny
\begin{align*}
0=&-(1-\alpha)\alpha u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)) \left(M^*(c)+c\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}\right)\\
&+\alpha(1-\alpha) u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c))) \left(M^*(c)+c\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}\right)\\
&-\alpha u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))(1-f'(M^*(c)))\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}
\end{align*}
\normalsize
- if $dM^*/dc=0$ was true, $c=1$ is optimal (check!)
- as $dM^*/dc>0$, $c^*<1$ can be optimal
*** partial coverage can be optimal                               :B_example:

    - $f(M)=M-M^2/2$, $\alpha=0.1$, $\bar M = 1$, $u(x)=-e^{-x}$ , $W>L>1$
    - first order condition (after canceling terms):
\tiny
$$0=-1.8 u'(W-c^2/10)+1.8 u'(W-c^2/10-L+c^2/2)-u'(W-c^2/10-L+c^2/2)$$
$$0=-1.8 +0.8 e^{L-c^2/2}$$
$$c=\sqrt{2L-2log(1.8/0.8)}=\sqrt{2L-1.62}$$

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: results
-  effects of higher $c$ 
  - more insurance, i.e. shifting ressources from good to bad state
  - more over-consumption of medical care

- cost sharing fights ex post moral hazard

* Ex ante moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts
# for models, see ZBK 6.4.1

** Ex ante moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts

- copayment can also be used to prevent ex ante moral hazard
- problem: multiple insurances
#
- other instruments to fight moral hazard
# subsidies for gym memberships etc.
