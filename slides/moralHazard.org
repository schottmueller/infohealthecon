* The slope of demand
** How does health care demand vary in the price the patient has to pay?
a higher price (i.e. less insurance)... 
1. ...does not affect the amount of health care a patient consumes
2. ...reduces the amount of health care a patient consumes
3. ...increases the amount of health care a patient consumes

How do you design a study that settles the argument?

# ** Demand in a simple model

# - derive demand in a standard 101 micro model and show it is decreasing in price


* Field experimental evidence

** RAND health insurance experiment I
- 70s in the US
- 2000 families
- randomly assigned plans differing in copay and stop-loss

** Oregon I

- Medicaid expansion in Oregon (2008)
- medium-low income 
- due to limited budget, lottery for eligibility
- no copayment, no premium
- use lottery success as instrument for health insurance
- roughly: compare lottery winners to losers

\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Oregon1}
\tiny{source: Einav and Finkelstein 2017}\normalsize

# procedure: 75000 applied and 30000 were selected; if selected apply fro Medicaid and if you met the criteria you got it; comprehensive coverage without cost sharing;
# winning in the lottery increased prob of having health insurance by 25 percentage points 
# 2 years after lottery Oregon had enough founds to also extend to "control group"
# estimates are IV estimated of local average treatment effect

** Oregon II
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Oregon2}
\tiny{source: Einav and Finkelstein 2017}\normalsize
- increase in health care spending due to Medicaid roughly 775$ per year (approx. 25%)

* Welfare and moral hazard
** Welfare 
- why is "moral hazard" actually a problem?

# deadweight loss in demand diagram

* Out of sample predictions
** Out of sample predictions

- A health insurer considers to introduce a copayment of 10% up to 5000€ and asks you how this will affect expenditures. What do you do?

# price elasticity of -0.2 (note that RAND used the arc elasticity, i.e. the percentage increase in out of pocket price would be (10-0)/((10+0)/2)=2=200%), hence share of people with expenditures below 5000 are expected to consume 2*0.2=40% less

# simple structural model, e.g. u_i=-(\theta-h)^2 +m, before change, i.e.  without copayment, everyone chooses h=\theta, this gives the distribution of h; under the new regime u_i is -(\theta-h)^2+m-0.1h if h is less than 5000, determine which h everyone will choose now

* Ex ante moral hazard
** Ex ante moral hazard
- what is the impact of insurance on preventive behavior, life style etc.?
#

- uninsured in the US who become eligible for Medicare when turning 65

Results: after turning 65...
- number of physician visits increases for low-educated by 35 (41)% for men (women)
- probability of engaging in vigorous physical activity falls by 21 (13)%

* Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts
** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: model
how does moral hazard affect optimal insurance contracts?
- loss equivalent to monetary loss of $L$ occurs with prob \alpha
- if loss occurs, consumer chooses medical spending $M\in[0,\bar M]$ to mitigate the loss to $L-f(M)$ 
  - assumptions: $f'>0$, $f''<0$, $f'(0)>1$, $f'(\bar M)<1$, $f(\bar M)\leq L$
- insurance costs premium $p$ and bares fraction $c$ of the medical spending
- simplifying assumption: fair premium, i.e. $p=\alpha cM^*$, where $M^*$ is optimal spending by the consumer
- what is the coverage level maximizing expected consumer utility?

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: analysis
- expected utility
$$ E[u] = (1-\alpha) u(W-p)+\alpha u(W-p-L-(1-c)M+f(M))$$
- consumer's optimal spending decision in case of loss:
# f'(M^*)=1-c, 
- how does $M^*$ react to $c$?
# higher c means higher M^* by f''<0; in fact dM^*/dc=-1/f''(M^*) 
- optimal choice of coverage

\small
$$ \max_{c\in[0,1]} (1-\alpha) u(W-\alpha cM^*(c))+\alpha u(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))$$

$$\Leftrightarrow \max_{c\in[0,1]} (1-\alpha) u(W-\alpha cM^*(c))+\alpha u(W-L+(1-\alpha)cM^*(c)-M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))$$

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: analysis

 first order condition: 
\tiny
\begin{align*}
0=&-(1-\alpha)\alpha u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)) \left(M^*(c)+c\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}\right)\\
&+\alpha(1-\alpha) u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c))) \left(M^*(c)+c\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}\right)\\
&-\alpha u'(W-\alpha cM^*(c)-L-(1-c)M^*(c)+f(M^*(c)))(1-f'(M^*(c)))\frac{dM^*(c)}{dc}
\end{align*}
\normalsize
- if $dM^*/dc=0$ was true, $c=1$ is optimal (check!)
- as $dM^*/dc>0$, $c^*<1$ can be optimal
*** partial coverage can be optimal                               :B_example:

    - $f(M)=M-M^2/2$, $\alpha=0.1$, $\bar M = 1$, $u(x)=-e^{-x}$ , $W>L>1$
    - first order condition (after canceling terms):
\tiny
$$0=-1.8 u'(W-c^2/10)+1.8 u'(W-c^2/10-L+c^2/2)-u'(W-c^2/10-L+c^2/2)$$
$$0=-1.8 +0.8 e^{L-c^2/2}$$
$$c=\sqrt{2L-2log(1.8/0.8)}=\sqrt{2L-1.62}$$

** Ex post moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts: results
-  effects of higher $c$ 
  - more insurance, i.e. shifting ressources from good to bad state
  - more over-consumption of medical care

- cost sharing fights ex post moral hazard

* Ex ante moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts
# for models, see ZBK 6.4.1

** Ex ante moral hazard and optimal insurance contracts

- copayment can also be used to prevent ex ante moral hazard
- problem: multiple insurances
#

* Utilization management
** Utilization management (UM)
- insurance causes over consumption of care 
  - copayments are an imperfect way to fight this problem
  - what else can insurer do to fight over consumption of care?

** Empirical evidence on utilization management I

- Wickizer, Wheeler and Feldstein (1989) and Wheeler and Wickizer (1990)
  - data from one US insurer 
  - 41% of groups buy plan with preadmission certification and concurrent review
  - results: 
    - 3.7% less hospital admissions but no effect on length of stay
    - UM more effective if in community admission rates are high or hospital capacity is idle 
  
- Scheffler, Sullivan and Ko (1991)
  - Blue Cross/Blue shield plans

# preadmission cert.: nonemergency hospital admission has to be cleared by insurer before admittance
# concurretn review: number of hospital days is specified in advance and increases have to be cleared by insurer
# retrospective review: review case expost and advise provider to follow insurer protocol if care deemed unnecessary
# denial of payment: insurer will not pay for care that is not in line with insurer protocol
# discharge planning: provider must make a plan for care after discharge before admitting
# problem: selection! groups choosing UM may know they need it

** Empirical evidence on utilization management II
- Lessler and Wickizer (2000)
  - one US health insurer with different groups (some with preadmission certification + concurrent review)
  - only cardiovascular disease patients
  - results
    - almost no requests for admission rejected
    - 17.5% of cases length of stay was reduced (19% for surgical procedures)
    - readmission rates: 12.4% no reduction, 9.4% if 1 day reduction, 14.6% if 2+ days reduction
# no admission reduction: cardivascular have no discretion, or providers know guidelines very well, or ineffective

** Gatekeeping
- gatekeeping: specialty care requires referral by general practicioner
  - what are the advantages?

\pause 

- Ferris er al. (2001)
  - Harvards Vanguard eliminated gatekeeping after 25 years in 1998 
  - compare utilization before and after elimination

| physician visits                   | gatekeeping | no gatekeeping |
|------------------------------------+-------------+----------------|
| /                                  |           < |                |

| number first visit specialist /6m  |         .19 |            .22 |
| number primary care visits /6m     |        1.21 |           1.19 |

# no statistical significance

# potential advantage: continuity of care i.e. GP has overview and manages as expert adviser, substitute expensive specialty by cheap GP, use capitation
