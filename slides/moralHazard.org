* The slope of demand
** How does health care demand vary in the price the patient has to pay?
a higher price (i.e. less insurance)... 
1. ...does not affect the amount of health care a patient consumes
2. ...reduces the amount of health care a patient consumes
3. ...increases the amount of health care a patient consumes

How do you design a study that settles the argument?

# ** Demand in a simple model

# - derive demand in a standard 101 micro model and show it is decreasing in price


* Field experimental evidence

** RAND health insurance experiment I
- 70s in the US
- 2000 families
- randomly assigned plans differing in copay and stop-loss

** RAND health insurance experiment II

- rough price elasticity estimate: -0.2

** Oregon I

- Medicaid expansion in Oregon (2008)
- medium-low income 
- due to limited budget, lottery for eligibility
- no copayment, no premium
- use lottery success as instrument for health insurance
- compare people who won in lottery to those who did not

** Oregon II
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Oregon2}

- increase in health care spending due to Medicaid roughly 775$ per year (approx. 25%)

* The donut hole

** The donut hole I

- Medicare Part D provides coverage for elderly for medication

How will the distribution of medication expenditure for Medicare recipients look like?

* Welfare and moral hazard
** Welfare 
- why is "moral hazard" actually a problem?

# deadweight loss in demand diagram

* Structural estimation
** Out of sample predictions

- A health insurer considers to introduce a copayment of 10% up to 5000€ and asks you how this will affect expenditures. What do you do?

# price elasticity of -0.2, hence share of people with expenditures below 5000 are expected to consume 20% less

# simple structural model, e.g. u_i=-(\theta-h)^2 +m, before change, i.e.  without copayment, everyone chooses h=\theta, this gives the distribution of h; under the new regime u_i is -(\theta-h)^2+m-0.1h if h is less than 5000, determine which h everyone will choose now
