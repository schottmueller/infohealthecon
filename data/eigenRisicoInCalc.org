- =SUM(D2:D136143)
- =SUM(E2:E136143)

* Average costs
** By hand:
mark all but row 1, Data->Sort-> according to column B

mark colum age, then Data->Filter->Standard Filter age=17
=AVERAGE(G26097:G27635)  

click in age column, Data->More Filters->Reset Filters

Data->Filter->Standard Filter age=19
=AVERAGE(G29173:G30713)

** Command
=AVERAGEIF(B2:B135631;"=17";G2:G135631)
=AVERAGEIF(B2:B135631;"=19";G2:G135631)

** Age expense graph
- make a column for age from 0 to 89 (here in K13:K102)
- next to it make a column average costs per head at this age using the formula
=AVERAGEIF(B2:B135631;"="&K13;G2:G135631) in L13
=AVERAGEIF(B2:B135631;"="&K13;G2:G135631) in L14 
and extend to L13:L102 by marking and dragging

- mark the average cost column (L13:102) and click on "insert chart"
- do the same but only take costs for ages 10 to 30 to see the 18 year drop

* Elasticity
relative change in deductible: (360-170)/(360/2+170/2)=0.717
bad (as non-deflated) estimate of relative change in expenditure 10 year old: (622-614)/(614/2+622/2)=0.0129
bad (as not deflated) elasticity: 0.0129/0.717 >0 (and roughly 0)

deflate with 17 year old cost increase: 
  - rel cost increase 17 year old: (830-779)/(830/2+779/2)=0.06339
  - deflate 2014 cost of 19 year old to 2011 prices: 622/1.06339=585
  - rel increase in cost of 19 year old at 2011 prices (585-614)/(585/2+614/2)=-0.0483
  - deflated elasticity: -0.0483/0.717=-0.0674
