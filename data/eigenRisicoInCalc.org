- choose language "English (USA)" to get comma/decimal right

- =SUM(D2:D136143)
- =SUM(E2:E136143)

* Average costs
** By hand:
mark all but row 1, Data->Sort-> according to column B

mark colum age, then Data->Filter->Standard Filter age=17
=AVERAGE(G26097:G27635)  

click in age column, Data->More Filters->Reset Filters

Data->Filter->Standard Filter age=19
=AVERAGE(G29173:G30713)

** Command
=AVERAGEIF(B$2:B$135631;"=17";G$2:G$135631)
=AVERAGEIF(B$2:B$135631;"=19";G$2:G$135631)

** Pivot table
- mark all data (including variable names)
- Insert-> Pivot table
- "ok" for current selection
- Row Fields: age, Column Fields: sex, Data Fields: costsPerHeadUnderDeductible
 (doubleclick on Sum-costsPerHeadUnderDeductible and change Sum to Average)

** Age expense graph
- make a column for age from 0 to 89 (here in K13:K102)
- next to it make a column average costs per head at this age using the formula
=AVERAGEIF(B$2:B$135631;"="&K13;G$2:G$135631) in L13
=AVERAGEIF(B$2:B$135631;"="&K13;G$2:G$135631) in L14 
and extend to L13:L102 by marking and dragging

- mark the average cost column (L13:102) and click on "insert chart"
- do the same but only take costs for ages 10 to 30 to see the 18 year drop

* Elasticity
relative change in deductible: (360-170)/(360/2+170/2)=0.717
bad (as non-deflated) estimate of relative change in expenditure 19 year old: (622-614)/(614/2+622/2)=0.0129
bad (as not deflated) elasticity: 0.0129/0.717 >0 (and roughly 0)

deflate with 17 year old cost increase: 
  - rel cost increase 17 year old: (830-779)/(830/2+779/2)=0.06339
  - deflate 2014 cost of 19 year old to 2011 prices: 622/1.06339=585
  - rel increase in cost of 19 year old at 2011 prices (585-614)/(585/2+614/2)=-0.0483
  - deflated elasticity: -0.0483/0.717=-0.0674

One can also deflate the deductible using the CPI:
CPIDeflator = 1.0246*1.0251*1.0098=1.06061 #CPI inflation rates 2012,2013 and 2014 in NL following https://www.inflation.eu
In this case, relative change in deductible = (360/CPIDeflator-170)/(360/(2*CPIDeflator)+170/2)=0.665
and deflated elasticity: -0.0483/0.665=-0.0726

* Compare to RAND
This is problematic because the RAND estimate is more applicable for increases in the copayment rate and not so much the deductible. The main difficulty, however, is that the RAND estimate refers to an increase in “out of pocket” spending. We cannot figure this out because we do not know how many people actually exceed the deductible (if we had individual data, i.e. if our data was not aggregated at postcode level, we would know this!).
