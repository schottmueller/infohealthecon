#+title: Empirical case study: Minimum deductible in the Netherlands
#+options: toc:nil
#+author: Christoph Schottmüller

In the lecture we discussed some evidence for moral hazard. The main question here is whether we can find some empirical evidence for moral hazard ourselves.[fn::This case study is based on material prepared by Jan Boone, see section "Regulation in health care markets"[[https://github.com/janboone/python_economics/blob/master/economics.org#simple-theory][ here]].]

In the Netherlands health insurance is provided by a handful semi-private health insurers. The base coverage is fixed by law and the law also mandates, since 2008 , a minimum deductible for all insured /above age 18/, i.e. there is no deductible or other copayment for kids. Copayments that do not take the form of a deductible are not used and most insured have a deductible equal to the legal minimum. The minimum deductible has been increased over time from the initial 150€ per year. (2009: € 155; 2010: € 165; 2011: € 170; 2012: € 220; 2013: € 350; 2014: € 360; 2015: € 375; 2016, 2017 en 2018: € 385). Cost data for the Netherlands is available on http://www.vektis.nl/index.php/vektis-open-data where for each (age,gender,postcode) triple you can find the total health care costs split up into different categories. On the course website I provide a simplified version of the data sets from 2011 and 2014 in which I changed the variable names to English and aggregated all the costs that fall under the deductible into one variable.

You can do the exercises below in a spreadsheet app (like Microsoft Excel or /OpenOffice Calc/) but even better suited would be a statistics software (like /R/ or Stata or SPSS) or a data analysis package in a general pupose programming language (like /Pandas for Python/ or /DataFrames for Julia/). (in italics those options that are free, open source and available for all usual operating systems; as you might have guessed, I use Julia)

17 year olds cost more. This could be age related expenditure but it also could indicate moral hazard, i.e. people consume less health care if they face a deductible. 

** Plotting cost distributions
To get a better idea of the difference we plot the distribution of costs (this is called a "histogram") for 17 and 19 year olds. I plot the logarithm of costs which seems to be almost normally distributed. 

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :exports code :session
#Histograms
histogram(df11[(df11[:,:age].=="17").& isfinite.(df11[:,:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible]),:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible],label="2011, age 17",alpha=0.5,normed=true,title="Distribution Log(costs per contribution year)  2011")
histogram!(df11[(df11[:,:age].=="19").& isfinite.(df11[:,:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible]),:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible],label="2011, age 19",alpha=0.5,normed=true)
#histogram(df14[(df14[:,:age].=="17").& isfinite.(df14[:,:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible]),:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible],label="2014, age 17",alpha=0.5,normed=true,title="Distribution Log(costs per contribution year) 2014")
#histogram!(df14[(df14[:,:age].=="19") .& isfinite.(df14[:,:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible]),:logCostsPerHeadUnderDeductible],label="2014, age 19",alpha=0.5,normed=true)

** Why compare with 2014?
The deductible more than doubled between 2011 and 2014. Hence, if the cost difference between 17 and 19 year old is due to moral hazard we would expect the cost difference to increase significantly. In fact that is what the results above already showed: in 2014 the cost difference is relatively larger.

** Demand elasticity for the deductible 
We can measure by how much the costs of 19 year olds decreased when their deductible increased from 170€ to 360€, i.e. we compare the average costs of 19 year olds in 2011 and 2014 (in fact we could do this also for all older people). 

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :exports both :session
#Estimate of elasticity
relIncreaseDeductible=(360-170)/(170/2+360/2)
relIncreaseCosts = (mean(df14[df14[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])-mean(df11[df11[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible]))/(mean(df11[df11[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/2+mean(df14[df14[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/2)

Ok something went wrong: The cost of 19 year olds actually increased from 2011 to 2014! This estimate suggests the opposite of moral hazard: an increasing demand function. But the reason is that we did not take into account that health care costs have risen over time irrespective of the deductible. We need a "deflator" to adjust 2014 costs to 2011 levels! I will use the cost increase of kids aged between 1 and 17 as deflator as they were not affected by the deductible (their deductible is zero in both years).[fn::There is a subtle question here whether the deductible should be deflated as well when computing the relative increase in the deductible. The relevant question is here whether consumers value 1€ differently in 2011 and 2014 which has little to do with increasing health care costs but depends on the general inflation rate. The correct deflator for the deductible is therefore usual consumer price index which I took from [[https://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/the-netherlands/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-the-netherlands.aspx][here]].]

deflator = 1+(-mean([mean(df11[(df11[:,:age].==string(age)) ,:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible]) for age in 1:17])+mean([mean(df14[(df14[:,:age].==string(age)) ,:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible]) for age in 1:17]))/(mean([mean(df11[(df11[:,:age].==string(age)) ,:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/2+mean(df14[(df14[:,:age].==string(age)),:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/2 for age in 1:17]));

relIncreaseCostsDeflated = (mean(df14[df14[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/deflator-mean(df11[df11[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible]))/(mean(df11[df11[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/2+mean(df14[df14[:,:age].=="19",:costsPerHeadUnderDeductible])/(2*deflator))

** Is there a way to compare the estimate of the previous exercise to the famous -0.2 demand elasticity from the RAND health insurance experiment?
This is problematic because the RAND estimate is more applicable for increases in the copayment rate and not so much the deductible. So the short -- and correct -- answer is "NO!". The main difficulty is that the RAND estimate refers to an increase in "out of pocket" spending. We cannot figure this out because we do not know how many people actually exceed the deductible (if we had individual data, i.e. if our data was not aggregated at postcode level, we would know this!). 

If we really want to give it a try (just to see whether we are in the right ballpark), we have to make some assumption and I will make the simple assumption that everyone spends more than the deductible, i.e. the increase in the deductible by 360-170=190€ leads to an increase of out-of-pocket spending by 190€ for everyone (this seems to be more of an upper bound than a good estimate, i.e. the true increase in out of pocket expenditure is less than that). The relative increase in the deductible (calculated above to be 99.663% when accounting for CPI inflation) equals under this assumption the relative increase in out of pocket expenditures. With the RAND estimate we should therefore expect a relative decrease in costs by $0.2*99.663%=-19.9%$. This is, of course, much larger than the actual decrease which is 9.11%. However, we aimed more for an upper bound than an accurate estimate. Also keep in mind that we are comparing apples and oranges here because the variation that lead to the RAND estimate was mainly variation in copayment rates while we are talking of an increase in the deductible.
