* Loading packages

This loads some statistics packages into julia which we will use below.
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output
using DataFrames, StatFiles, CSV, GLM, Statistics
#+END_SRC

* Data set creation

The following code generates the data set I uploaded from the data set the authors provide on their website. 

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
df = DataFrame(load("replicationdata.dta"))

df1 = df[(df[:,:nhbtwgxd].!==missing) .& (df[:,:robpnhd].!==missing) .&(df[:,:pnhd].!==missing),[:pnhd, :nhbtwgxd,:robpnhd,:ltcinsd,:asset1,:asset2,:asset3,:prevent,:seatbelt,:sex,:inc1,:inc2,:inc3]]

rename!(df1,Dict(:nhbtwgxd => "dEnterNH",:pnhd => "belief", :robpnhd => "insPrediction"))
df1.dSeatbelt = (df1.seatbelt.==1) # create dummy that is 1 if seatbelt is used for "all or most" trips

CSV.write("FMcGdata.csv",df1)
#+END_SRC

* Analysis

** read in data
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
df1 = CSV.read("FMcGdata.csv",DataFrame)
df2=dropmissing(df1) #data set without missing observations
#+End_src

#+RESULTS:

** descriptive statistics (question 1-3)

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
describe(df1)
#+End_src

#+RESULTS:

** scope for adverse selection
To have adverse selection, people need to have private information and use this information in their insurance purchase behavior.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
# 4: Is belief about entering nursing home influencing demand for long term care insurance?
lm(@formula(ltcinsd~belief),df1)

# 5:  Does the belief contain information, i.e. is it more likely to enter nursing home when one believes so?
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~belief),df1)

# 6: Does the belief contain information even when controlling for the insurance estimate, i.e. is it more likely to enter nursing home when one believes so controlling for insurance estimate?
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~belief+insPrediction),df1)
#+END_SRC

** advantageous selection
Adverse selection would predict a positive correlation between insurance purchases and the probability of entering nursing home (i.e. high risk people have a higher demand for insurance). As we see below the actual correlation is negative.
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :exports code
#7: Are we having adverse selection, i.e. are those buying long term care insurance more likely to enter a nursing home?
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~ltcinsd),df1)
#+end_src

*** risk aversion as a driver of advantageous selection

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
#8: Is risk aversion a driver of advantageous selection?
#risk aversion measured by seatbelt use
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~dSeatbelt),df1)
lm(@formula(ltcinsd~dSeatbelt),df1)

#risk aversion measured by preventive efforts
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~prevent),df1)
lm(@formula(ltcinsd~prevent),df1)
#+end_src

*** wealth as a driver of advantageous selection
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports both :returns output :tangle yes :results output 
#9: Is wealth a driver of advantageous selection?
lm(@formula(dEnterNH~asset1+asset2+asset3),df1)
lm(@formula(ltcinsd~asset1+asset2+asset3),df1)
#+end_src
