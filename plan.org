* News
  - preliminary exam dates are Feb 21, 15:00 (100 Aula 1) and March 30 17:00 (105 HS A1).
#  - The post exam review (for the exam in September) takes place on October 18 and 19. Further information about how to register can be found [[https://wiso.uni-koeln.de/de/studium/studienorganisation/klausureinsichtnahmen/mikrooekonomik][here]].
#  - Note that there will be an exercise session on October 11 even though this is before the first lecture. This exercise session is dedicated to repeating some mathematical concepts used in this course.
# - There is now a bonus [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/fZgvh#BjYObqx5HECW89rpYxEnxg][screencast]] available on endogenous treatment choice. It is a topic that we do not cover this year but which allows to tie the things together that we covered in the last weeks.
# - I added some notes and a screencast on how you could have solved the case study on long term care insurance in either LibreOfficeCalc or julia; see "course materials" below.
# - Please, prepare the longterm care insurance (advantageous selection) case study for the lecture on Dec. 16. For data and instructions, see "course material" below.
# - The exam date is March 5, 2021; 13:00-14:00. There will be a second exam date in the summer term 2021. However, the exact date will not be published any time soon as the room situation remains unclear.
# - University policies do not allow on campus teaching for courses with more than 50 students. Lecture and exercise session will therefore be moved online. Links for the respective zoom meetings have been sent to your university email account.
# - Unfortunately, the board of examiners has decided that no exam inspections are allowed to take place for the time being. We hope that this slightly odd situation will change soon and we will then schedule a date for the exam inspection as soon as possible (here and on the exam office's website).
# - some points on the exam:
#  - In calculation exercises answering "2+√2" is fine. There is no need to calculate that this equals 3.4142....
#  - In essay type questions, the default should be to answer in complete sentences (no single word bullet points or similar).
#  - Explain your answers. In calculation exrcises the explanations can be brief and complete sentences are not required. 
# - On Jan. 15, we will discuss the empirical case study in the lecture (see the "exercises"). I will use LibreOffice Calc in class and provide a solution in Julia online. Please try to solve it yourself beforehand.
# - The optional post exam review takes place on April 17 between 10:00 and 11:30. Further information can be found [[https://www.wiso.uni-koeln.de/de/studium/studienorganisation/klausureinsichtnahmen/gesundheitsoekonomie/][here]].
# - The exam results have been forwarded to the examination office. The post-exam review will take place after the term break and a specific date will be announced later. 
# - Information on the exam: 
#  - The exam is "/closed book/" but you are allowed to bring a pocket calculator that is (i) not programmable and (ii) not graphical. 
#  - The second exam date is March 22, 8:45-9:45 in Aula I.
#  - The exam will take place on February 3, 16:15-17:15 in HS B.
#  - Students asked me to indicate some exercise questions that could be exam questions with a rough idea of how many points these exercises would give. I give some examples in the following, however, the point estimates are rough and may differ from the way points are awarded int he exam. 
 #   - Insurance demand: exercise 5 and 6 (10 points each)
 #   - adverse selection: exercise 1a (5 points), 1d (5 points), 1e+1f (together 10 points), 1h (10 points)
 #   - moral hazard: exercise 4 (10 points) 
# - Note that there will be an exercise session on October 7 even though this is before the first lecture covering [[https://github.com/schottmueller/infohealthecon/files/3685313/Exercise.Sheet.1.pdf][these]] questions. This exercise session is dedicated to repeating some mathematical concepts used in this course (distributions, expected value etc.). 

* Prerequisites and background
Several students asked for references for the prerequisites in terms of mathematics, statistics and microeconomics. For all of these areas there are literally hundreds of books titled "(Intermediate/Introductory) Microeconomics" or "Mathematics/Statistics for Business/Economics" and all of them cover more or less the same material. For concreteness, I name "Intermediate Microeconomis" ("Grundzüge der Mikroökonomik") by Hal Varian where chapters 1-6 are assumed to be known and chapter 12 is what we covered in the second lecture. Chapters 14-16 might be interesting background reading as well. For mathematics, "Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis" by Sysdsæter, Hammond, Strøm and Carvajal may be useful. German speaking students may also be interested in Peter Dörsam's book "Mathematik anschaulich dargestellt für Studierende der Wirtschaftswissenschaften". I am not familiar with statistics books but everything targeted at first semester business/economics students should be fine. Essentially, you have to know what a distribution is, how to compute an expected value and a variance, what a hypothesis test is and how an OLS regression works. While it skips some of the basic statistics the first 2 chapters in "Mastering Metrics: The path from cause to effect" by Angrist and Pischke might be used as an application oriented introduction to empirical work. Throughout the course we assume that your high school math knowledge is working and we have no time to repeat this material, e.g. make sure you can solve linear and quadratic equations, take derivatives and know their interpretation and integrate simple functions before week 1 of the semester.

If you want to take a less broad approach in catching up, the internet offers a variety of materials and formats (lecture notes, video tutorials on major online video platforms, interactive websites) that can be found with the usual search engines. For example, Wikipedia provides short definitions and explanations on all above mentioned topics (and often links to more in depth material). 

* Course materials

Please note that I do not use ILIAS because (i) I did not agree with certain usage conditions concerning tracking and data utilization and (ii) I believe that the material I create should be publically available as it is essentially funded by public money. The material below is likely to get updated over the course of the term.

Lecture slides and exercises are posted/updated here over the course of the term. You can find the source code creating the slides as Emacs org-mode files (".org") [[https://github.com/schottmueller/infohealthecon/tree/master/slides][here]].

** Julia notebooks
/This is very optional (!!!) but if you are interested/, there are some julia/jupyter [[https://github.com/schottmueller/infohealthecon/blob/master/exercises/exercisePlots.ipynb][notebooks]] that can compute the resuls to some of the exercises or create the plots I use. The idea is the following: If you want to practice more, you can simply change the income or the utility function and redo the exercise with these new primitives. The code allows you to check whether your calculation were correct. On how to set up julia -- which is free and open source software -- see [[https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started_julia/index.html][here]]. If you want to learn julia from scratch, you can check the free online book [[https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html][ThinkJulia]] or use the online courses on [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming][Coursera]] or [[https://juliaacademy.com/][JuliaAcademy]].


* Course setup 
In this course, we will analyze the consequences of information problems in health care markets and look for possible solutions to those problems on a theoretical basis. The theoretical analysis is at times supplemented with empirical evidence.

Students learn economic methods to analyze health care markets theoretically and also gain some insight in how to design empirical tests of the predictions of the theoretical models. 

The course consists of a lecture and an exercise session. Models, their solutions and implications as well as empirical evidence are presented in the lecture. In the exercise classes, solution to exercises are discussed. Students are expected to work on the exercises beforehand. Exercises consist mainly of calculation exercises using (variations of) models introduced in class but also discussion questions on specific applications. 

The exam will -- in style -- be similar to the questions of the exercise classes. It is, for the time being, planned as a written exam.

** Lecture times: 
- lecture: Wednesday, 10:00-11:30 in 101/EG/27 HS XXV
- exercise classes: Monday, 14:00-15:30 (online via zoom)
# in 100/HSXII

# University policies do not allow on campus teaching for courses with more than 50 students. Lecture and exercise session will therefore be moved online.

** Textbooks
The course is not based on a single textbook. The majority of topics is covered in cite:zweifel2009health (library link to [[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-540-68540-1][ebook]]). cite:morrisey2008health (link to [[https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=217420&site=ehost-live][ebook]]) covers also many of the discussed topics but has an (almost entirely) empirical approach. Detailed references are given in the schedule below.
